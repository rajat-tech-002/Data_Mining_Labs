   Sun Microsystems Inc. said it will post a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss of as much as $26 million and may show a loss in the current first quarter, raising further troubling questions about the once high-flying computer workstation maker. 

   Sun reported last month that management errors, rather than a weakness in the market for computer workstations, would result in lower earnings or a "slight loss" in the quarter ended June 30. 
But the amount cited in yesterday's disclosure was far greater than analysts had suspected, and suggested deepening troubles. 

   "It is extremely disconcerting," said Peter Rogers, computer analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. in San Francisco. 
"Many of us had been led to believe that most (of the management-systems problems) had been put behind them. 
It looks like there is another layer." 

   "On the surface, it would lead one to conclude that Sun has at least temporarily completely lost control of its operations," Mr. Rogers added. 

   The maker of high-performance desktop computers now says the loss was probably between $20 million and $26 million, compared with year-ago net income of $25.3 million, or 66 cents a share. 

   The huge fourth-quarter loss will bring year-end earnings to between $55 million and $61 million, or between 72 cents and 78 cents a share, compared with year-ago net of $66.4 million, or 89 cents a share. 

   Sun said it expects to report fourth-quarter revenue of $425 million to $435 million, up 16% to 19% from a year earlier. 
That would contrast sharply with Sun's third quarter, when revenue surged 92%, and would put full-year revenue in the $1.75 billion to $1.77 billion range, up from $1.05 billion a year earlier. 

   Sun said the problems that led to the loss have "largely been resolved," and that it received record bookings in its fourth quarter. 
Still, Sun said profitability in the current quarter, ending Sept. 30, can't be assured. 
The company added that a return to profitability will depend on the effectiveness of cost-cutting measures and its ability to obtain parts. 
A spokeswoman said the company still faces a shortage of certain parts. 

   In June, Sun said operations were disrupted by a change to a new system for getting information to management. 
The company also cited faulty forecasting of demand, problems in manufacturing new machines and a shortage of certain parts. 
The spokeswoman reiterated that the company sees strong demand for its products, and believes the market for computer workstations remains healthy. 

   Sun said it has imposed a hiring freeze in all areas except sales and customer service, postponed moving into new facilities and curtailed other expenses. 
The spokeswoman wouldn't say how much the cost-cutting measures will save. 

   The announcement was made after the market closed. 
Sun's stock closed at $16.25, up 62.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.

   Bush administration efforts to kill production of Grumman Corp.'s F-14 jet fighters collapsed in the House, as Republican leaders surprisingly decided to abandon the fight at the last minute. 

   The House, approving a $305 billion defense authorization bill, dealt President Bush a second setback by rejecting his proposal for simultaneous development of two mobile-missile systems. 
By supporting both the nuclear-tipped Midgetman and the larger, multiple-warhead MX placed on special railroad cars, the White House had hoped to forge a bipartisan coalition to break a legislative impasse over upgrading U.S. land-based missiles. 

   But the fragile compromise fell apart moments before final passage, stripping the measure of funds to begin deployment of either option. 
Liberal Democrats opposed to Midgetman, and Republicans -- many of whom felt betrayed by earlier moves to slash MX funding -- managed to gut the White House strategy by approving a final amendment on a procedural 176-90 vote. 

   Despite an emotional plea by Armed Services Committee chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) that the gambit would "blow everything up at the end," the revised bill passed by a 261-162 vote. 
By cutting deeply money requested for the two missiles, the B-2 Stealth bomber and a proposed space-based anti-missile shield, Rep. Aspin said after the vote that the House bill "pretty well shredded George Bush's strategic programs." 

   The House's position on land-based missiles and the Navy's F-14 jets conflict with the version of the bill taking shape in the Senate, setting the stage for prolonged negotiations to work out the differences. 

   In a shift that caught many of his allies flat-footed, Rep. William Dickinson (R., Ala.), the administration's point man to kill Grumman's F-14, opted to withdraw an amendment seeking to shut down the production line on Long Island. 
The decision came in the face of strong bipartisan support for the embattled F-14. 

   Capping months of intense lobbying by Grumman and its supporters, Rep. Dickinson's move kept about $1 billion to continue F-14 production in the bill. 

   Rep. Dickinson also agreed to withdraw a separate amendment to kill the V-22, a planned $25 billion Marine Corps troop transport opposed by the administration. 
The tilt-rotor aircraft, designed to take off like a helicopter but cruise like a plane, is being developed by units of Boeing Co. and Textron Inc. 

   While providing a big boost for Grumman and its embattled carrier-based fighter, yesterday's moves were a major political setback -- as well as a bitter personal defeat -- for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 

   Almost from the moment he became defense chief four months ago, Mr. Cheney, a former Republican House leader, has staked his reputation and much of his political goodwill on trying to persuade Congress to scuttle the F-14 and other programs for budget reasons. 
He also has worked hard to convince Congress that putting money into both mobile missiles gives U.S. arms-control negotiatiors maximum flexibility. 

   As the ranking GOP member of the Armed Services Commitee, Rep. Dickinson was his chief ally in both fights. 

   But after a series of meetings Wednesday night and yesterday morning with Grumman supporters -- including Republican lawmakers from New York and Florida -- Rep. Dickinson had a change of heart. 
He apparently concluded that his F-14 and V-22 amendments would be resoundingly defeated, and after consulting with Mr. Cheney and other senior House Republicans he decided to avoid a showdown. 

   In the Senate, Mr. Bush couldn't avoid a showdown over an amendment to cut $500 million from the proposed anti-missile shield, called the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
But with Vice President Quayle presiding in case of a tie vote, the Senate voted 50-47 to support the administration and retain $4.5 billion for SDI.

   Tokyo stocks closed higher in healthy trading, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues climbing to a record. 

   London share prices ended sharply higher as the market drew inspiration from a firm pound, a robust performance on Wall Street, and a renewal of speculative buying interest. 

   In Tokyo, the Nikkei was up 269.45 points at 34785.28, breaking the record of 34538.90 set Tuesday. 

   In midmorning trading Friday, the Nikkei index was up 42.91 points to 34828.19. 

   Positive external market factors bolstered bullishness in the market Thursday. 
The "triple merits" of lower oil prices, a stronger yen and the prospect of lower interest rates resulting from an easing of monetary policy in the U.S. brought institutional and individual investors into the market, brokers said. 

   The allocation of investment trust fund money through the week will help sustain the market rally, according to observers. 

   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.30 billion shares, up from 1.07 billion shares Wednesday. 

   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 591 to 332, and 173 issues were unchanged. 

   Market movement Wednesday set up a favorable environment for anticipated heavy trading Thursday, the first trading day for August settlement. 
"Wednesday was exactly what we needed. 
The market went too high and came back in the afternoon to put us back on track for today," said one trader. 

   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which gained 2.06 points Wednesday, was up 19.35 points at 2605.48. 

   Positive fundamental factors helped stimulate active trading by investors. 
Large institutional investors had been sidelined for the last couple of months waiting for the results of Sunday's upper house election. 

   The broad rally in the market included many sectors that have lagged because of recent market sluggishness. 
Among them are pharmaceuticals, life insurance, railroads, electric power and real estate. 

   Big buying orders by one of the "big four" brokerage firms for pharmaceuticals started that sector rolling, a trader said.Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals was up 70 yen (50 cents) at 3,800 yen ($27.11). 
Mochida Pharmaceuticals was up 90 yen at 3,640. 

   In the nonlife insurance sector, Taisho Marine was up 60 yen at 1,540, and Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine was up 60 yen at 1,520. 

   Railroad and real estate issues also showed strength. 
Tokyu gained 90 yen to 1,850, Keisei Electric Rail rose 150 yen to 2,650 and Keihin Electric Express Railway was up 60 yen at 1,720. 
Mitsui Real Estate rose 100 yen to 2,710, and Heiwa Real Estate gained 30 yen to 2,050. 

   Meanwhile, in London, dealers also attributed a portion of the day's sharp gain to the actions of market makers, who interpreted the market's positive sentiment as an excuse to mark prices higher. 

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 19.2 points firmer at 2283.7 points, after touching a high for the day of 2287.4. 
At its lowest, the index stood at 2274.2. 

   "The strong pound again revived hopes that the next move in U.K. interest rates will be downward," one trader noted. 

   At the close, the narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 16.7 points at 1902.5. 
Turnover at the close was a mediocre 481.3 million shares, up from 333.2 million Wednesday. 

   At the London close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.73 points at 2621.78. 
Glaxo ended 32 pence (53 cents) higher at #14.25 ($23.61), buoyed by news of a merger between U.S. pharmaceutical companies Bristol-Myers and Squibb. 
Last week, Glaxo's shares were dented by rumors that it would merge with Squibb. 
In sympathy, Amersham rose 8 pence to 490, and Fisons climbed 8 to 338. 

   Half-year earnings at Imperial Chemical Industries were largely in line with expectations, but the company reported a #41 million exceptional gain because of disposals and rationalizations that was coolly received by the market. 
ICI shares, which gained as much as 21 pence initially, ended just 1 pence higher at #12.55. 

   Reuters surged 45 pence to 809 as 2.4 million shares changed hands, reportedly on heavy buying from U.S. institutions. 
One Reuters market maker said a presentation Wednesday by Kidder Peabody in the U.S. underpinned the interest. 

   "Reuters interim results were strong, and there has been follow-through buying all week," a trader noted. 

   A number of the market's favorite speculative stocks also posted gains Thursday. 
Reckitt &amp; Colman rose 18 pence to 1214, B.A.T Industries climbed 11 pence to 888, and Pearson advanced 18 pence to 764. 

   In Frankfurt, share prices ended mixed after seesawing throughout the session on bouts of profit-taking and renewed buying. 
Stocks in Paris closed higher in active trading on signs of easier U.S. interest rates. 
Brokers gave U.S. markets much of the credit for the advance. 

   In Zurich, share prices rose in active trading, driven by aggressive and widespread purchases in the banking and insurance sectors, brokers said. 
Share prices in Amsterdam rose to a record, boosted by opening gains on Wall Street, but many issues ended slightly off their highs after a round of profit-taking. 

   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Brussels, Stockholm and Milan. 
South African gold stocks closed higher. 

   In Taipei, the market advanced sharply on relatively active buying. 
The Council for Economic Planning and Development forecast economic growth of 7% annually over the next four years. 

   In other Asian and Pacific trading, share prices closed higher in Sydney, Manila and Wellington, mixed in Hong Kong and lower in Seoul and Singapore. 

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. 
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. 
The percentage change is since year-end.

@  Coffee Futures Prices Extend Their Declines
@  As Producers Continue Their Aggressive Selling

   Coffee futures prices extended their declines as producers continued their aggressive selling of green coffee. 

   The September contract ended with a loss of 1.93 cents a pound at 83.44 cents after trading as low as 83.10 cents, a new life-of-contract low. 

   Traders were apparently ignoring a meeting on the current market situation scheduled for this weekend in Colombia and involving that nation as well as Brazil and Mexico, according to Arthur Stevenson, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. 

   Coffee prices began to slip significantly June 12, when the September contract fell 6.23 cents a pound and settled below $1.20 as traders began to believe that a new International Coffee Agreement might not be reached. 

   When the International Coffee Organization, the agreement's parent body, suspended export quotas early this month, the price drop was accelerated. 
More recently, it has slowed but hasn't stopped. 
As of yesterday's close, the September contract had fallen 42.54 cents a pound, or 34%, since June 10. 

   "It's a deregulated market that's somewhat out of control," said Mr. Stevenson. 
"Particularly aggressive sellers have been Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Indonesia. 
They have mountains of coffee to sell. 
But they're fighting not only to sell coffee, but to increase their market share." 

   Mr. Stevenson also said this is the time of year when Brazil's crops are most vulnerable to frost damage, which normally causes cautious selling of coffee by producing countries. 

   "But the weather in Brazil has been very stable and mild, and the lack of threatening cold weather has spurred selling by Brazil and others," he said. 

   Other price-depressing factors, Mr. Stevenson said, were hedge selling in the futures market by trade firms and by coffee roasters who have bought coffee and want to protect its value against further declines, as well as a weak technical situation. 

   When the September price yesterday traded below 83.50 cents to 83.60 cents, selling orders that had been placed there were triggered and helped to depress prices to their low of the day, Mr. Stevenson said. 

   A New York coffee importer and dealer said, "Obviously the market hasn't yet found its bottom." 

   Some producing countries, he said, continue to push sales of coffee, which in turn is depressing futures prices. 

   "I don't see an end to the selling pressure in the immediate future, and a leveling off may not come until roasters begin to buy significant quantities for their winter needs," he said. 

   At the moment, roasters aren't eager to buy, he said. 
But by late August or early September, that's expected to change. 

   As an example of what's available now, the dealer said, Brazilian coffee can be purchased for 73.50 cents a pound and Colombian at 86 cents. 
Mexican coffee is offered at 73.50 cents, he said, while Indonesian is available for 49 cents a pound. 

   African producers haven't been willing to compete by cutting their prices for Robusta coffee, so Robustas produced by Brazil have been setting the pace in that market at 57.50 cents, the dealer said. 
He also said Philippine Robustas can be bought for 39 cents a pound. 

   In other commodity markets yesterday: 

   SUGAR: Futures prices rose on rumors that India may buy a large quantity of sugar, but late selling trimmed the advance. 
The October contract ended with a gain of 0.25 cent a pound at 14.47 cents after trading as high as 14.54 cents. 
One dealer cited a wire-service report that India might buy between 300,000 and 500,000 tons of refined sugar for shipment in October. 
"When that report hit the floor, prices soared, but they settled back later on," the dealer said. 
An analyst, Bernard Savaiko of Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said many countries, some from the Third World, that need sugar but are short of foreign exchange may be hesitating to pay the current high world-market prices. 
White sugar is particularly expensive these days, at more than $100 a ton above the price of raw sugar. 
"If these countries do buy, it could cause prices to really soar," Mr. Savaiko said. 

   ENERGY: Most petroleum futures prices fell again in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery ended the session 18 cents a barrel lower, at $18.12. 
Later months were lower as well. 
Market observers continued to point to oversupply and weak demand as reasons for the decline -- the fifth in a row. 
And most suggested a good likelihood that crude prices might drop more. 
Reports of overproduction among Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- particularly Kuwait -- continued to be strong. 
Refiners late yesterday were again slashing the price they will pay for WTI. 
Several of them lopped another 50 cents off their postings to $17.50 a barrel. 
Products were mixed, with gasoline closing higher and heating oil lower. 

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices rose moderately, rebounding from recent declines following a government forecast of drier-than-normal weather. 
The National Weather Service's 6- to 10-day outlook, released late Wednesday after the market closed, signaled low rainfall in parts of the Western Corn Belt. 
Also, some traders felt "we'd had enough on the downside for the time being," said Robert Lekberg, analyst with Farmers Grain &amp; Livestock Corp., Chicago. 
However, "I'm not personally convinced that the price slide is over," Mr. Lekberg added, noting that the corn crop is progressing well in many regions. 
Rumors circulated that the Soviet Union had made a large purchase of soybeans or soybean meal from Brazil, but they weren't confirmed late in the day.

   Security Pacific Corp., moving to solidify links to a powerful Japanese ally, said it signed a letter of intent to acquire a 20% stake in Mitsui Manufacturers Bank for $38 million. 

   Mitsui Manufacturers is a Los Angeles-based unit of Mitsui Bank Ltd., Tokyo, which is the ninth largest bank in the world, with assets of $220 billion. 
This is believed to be the first time a U.S. bank has bought into a U.S.-based arm of a Japanese bank. 

   Security Pacific, also based in Los Angeles, said Mitsui Bank will work with its Tokyo branch on loan originations, customer referrals and a broad array of other services. 
The banking concern also said one of its current executives will be named president and chief operating officer of Mitsui Manufacturers, and Mitsui said some of its senior executives in Japan will work at Security Pacific there. 

   Last month, Security Pacific said it had agreed to sell Mitsui 5% of its consumer and commercial services group for $100 million. 
A Mitsui unit also is a 50% partner in Security Pacific's commercial finance company in Japan. 

   "You don't get married after a couple of dates, but it's obvious that these people are certainly interested in dancing," said George Salem, a banking analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 
"Who knows what will develop?" 

   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Security Pacific's common closed at $51.50, up $1.125, on trading of 4.2 million shares. 
Some of the heavy volume was due to dividend-related activity. 

   Security Pacific is the U.S.'s fifth largest banking company, with assets of $85.1 billion. 
Robert H. Smith, president, said neither Security Pacific nor Mitsui envisions merging the two institutions and that Security Pacific has no plans to increase its stake in Mitsui Manufacturers. 
But he said the companies foresee the evolution of a "global partnership," and it's clear that Security Pacific thinks that is the best way to enter the insular but lucrative Japanese market. 

   Mr. Smith said that buying into Mitsui Manufacturers, which has $1.4 billion of assets, will increase Security Pacific's presence in the so-called middle market -- generally, companies that have between $2 million and $25 million in annual sales. 
That market has been one of the most consistently profitable in banking in recent years, but Security Pacific only recently began to push into it. 

   Security Pacific's developing links with Mitsui prompted speculation that other big U.S. banks may seek Japanese partners. 
The world's 10 biggest banks are Japanese, and much of the world's economic growth is coming from the Pacific rim, Mr. Salem said, so "it makes sense to have a Pacific rim partner of that size in a world that's becoming more global and interdependent all the time."

   Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp., two longtime rivals in the pharmaceutical industry, agreed to merge in a stock swap valued at $11.52 billion. 

   The companies said the merger would create the world's second-largest drug company, after Merck &amp; Co. 
The move is the biggest in a recent flurry of combinations and, because it involves two strong companies, is especially telling of the enormous competitive pressures in the industry world-wide and the staggering cost of turning laboratory discoveries into effective and profitable drugs. 

   "The pharmaceutical industry is truly global," said Richard L. Gelb, chairman and chief executive officer of Bristol-Myers. 
"To compete successfully you clearly have to have a critical mass around the world." 

   The announcement follows by a day the completion of SmithKline Beckman Corp.'s combination with London's Beecham Group PLC, barely eclipsing their claim as the No. 2 drug maker and putting increased pressure on SmithKline Beecham PLC to deliver on the promised $600 million in cost savings and other benefits of their trans-Atlantic marriage. 

   Other recent consolidations include Dow Chemical Co.'s planned combination with Marion Laboratories Inc. and Eastman Kodak Co.'s acquisition of Sterling Drug Inc. "Now more than ever it's size that matters," said David MacCallum, drug-industry analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist. 

   Mr. Gelb and Richard M. Furlaud, his counterpart at Squibb, described the proposed merger as a "unique fit" of each company's research and marketing strengths, and a joining of organizations with remarkably similar cultures. 
It would also unite Mr. Gelb and Mr. Furlaud, who have been friends since their daughters attended the same Manhattan school for girls 25 years ago. 
The executives said the decision to merge resulted only from their own conversations and, despite recent Wall Street rumors, wasn't prompted by threats from any other company. 

   Wall Street analysts generally liked the logic behind the combination, but some were unnerved by the price Bristol-Myers is paying. 

   "Squibb shareholders should be thrilled silly," said Neil Sweig, drug-industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Bristol-Myers holders will suffer about a 15% dilution in earnings per share and should expect a difficult 12 to 24 months at least, he said. 
Ronald Nordmann, a PaineWebber analyst, called it "a deal done for the next century." 

   Under the agreement, Bristol-Myers would exchange on a tax-free basis 2.4 common shares for each of Squibb's 97 million common shares outstanding. 
Bristol-Myers shares yesterday closed at $49.50, off $2.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
That means the value of the transaction to Squibb holders is $118.80 for each of their Squibb shares. 

   Squibb stock, which had risen $3.375 a share Wednesday, soared an additional $24.75 yesterday, closing at $112.50 in Big Board trading. 
The Squibb closing price reflects the belief of traders that the merger is a done deal and no one is likely to make a competing bid. 
But in case another suitor does emerge, the companies agreed to a lockup arrangement entitling Bristol-Myers to purchase a 20% stake in Squibb for $123.90 a share, or $2.4 billion. 

   The premium that Bristol-Myers is paying -- 35% over Squibb's closing price Wednesday of $87.75 a share, and even more over its $80 range before the company became the subject of takeover rumors in the past few days -- is unusually high for a tax-free stock swap. 
The premiums paid in other recent big stock-swap proposals have ranged from 10% to 20%. 
People familiar with the transaction attributed the high premium to Squibb's strength, and indicated that the price would reduce the chances that another company might try to make a higher bid. 

   "If they {Bristol-Myers} wanted the company {Squibb}, that's what they had to pay," said a person close to Squibb. 
"We could have done this deal with other companies." 

   By structuring the transaction as a stock swap, Bristol-Myers will avoid adding to its books about $11 billion in good will that would have to be charged against earnings over the next 40 years. 
Good will refers to the difference between the price paid for a company and the net book value of its assets. 

   Mr. Gelb acknowledged the expected dilution of earnings per share. 
"We very clearly are interested in coming out of dilution as fast as we can," he said. 

   Mr. Gelb, 66 years old, would be chairman and chief executive officer of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Mr. Furlaud, 65, would be president and in charge of the new company's pharmaceutical business. 

   Last year the companies had combined net income of $1.25 billion, on revenue of $8.6 billion, of which $4.2 billion was in pharmaceuticals. 
Their research and development spending totaled $600 million, second world-wide in the industry to Merck, and they employed a total of 53,000 people. 
Mr. Furlaud said that while ambitious hiring plans of both companies would be sharply curtailed as a result of the merger, he doesn't anticipate any layoffs. 

   The merger addresses challenges facing the companies as they try to maintain their rates of growth. 
Squibb has huge sales, about $1 billion a year, from its heart drug, Capoten, a treatment for hypertension and certain other types of cardiovascular disease. 
But to sustain double-digit profit growth, Squibb has scurried to expand its research operations into new areas such as the treatment of brain-related disorders. 

   But that will take years and tremendous capital. 
Bristol-Myers can help provide those funds, plus research programs in areas such as cancer where Squibb is just beginning projects. 

   "The cost of biomedical research is escalating at a rate double the rate of inflation," Mr. Furlaud said. 
Drug companies can count on investing at least $50 million and about 10 years on each drug they develop that reaches the market, he added. 

   Squibb officials concede that the company also is unable to marshal the marketing muscle to go up against Merck and other drug giants. 
Company insiders say Squibb was speaking to Bristol-Myers in recent months, before the merger talks, about forming a joint venture to sell Squibb's experimental cholesterol-lowering drug, Pravachol, which is expected to be approved for marketing sometime next year. 
The drug is similar to Merck's Mevacor, already on the market, and is believed to have huge sales potential. 
But Squibb officials need Bristol-Myers to provide the resources to compete against Merck. 

   Moreover, Bristol-Myers makes and sells a broad range of health-care and other consumer products, including such brand names as Bufferin, Excedrin, Miss Clairol, Windex and Drano. 
Its presence in the over-the-counter drug market in particular, analysts say, will be significant as more drugs now dispensed only by prescription are marketed on drugstore shelves. 
Finally, the merger fortifies Squibb, often rumored as a takeover target, against any attempts that would force it into unwanted alliances. 

   For its part, Squibb gives Bristol-Myers basic research and future products in areas where Bristol-Myers has been a presence but has few new or exciting drugs. 
For instance, Bristol-Myers's Questran cholesterol-lowering drug made the company the premier marketer of such medicines. 
But it has been overtaken by Merck and Warner-Lambert Co., which have newer drugs. 
Squibb's Pravachol would immediately restore Bristol-Myer's position as a major player in the anti-cholesterol market. 

   Squibb, based in Princeton, N.J., has marketing and distribution operations overseas in markets that New York-based Bristol-Myers covets, company officials said. 
There is little overlap in the companies' product lines world-wide or in geographical strength, analysts added. 

   Messrs. 
Gelb and Furlaud said the idea of merging evolved out of discussions of their industry's future that the two men have held over the past several years at Mr. Furlaud's apartment on Manhattan's Central Park South. 

   "We saw problems of cost-containment {among health-care customers} and lots of things were in ferment," said Mr. Gelb. 
"Ultimately we thought our companies would have to change." 
Then, two weeks ago, over Mr. Gelb's Perrier and lime and Mr. Furlaud's scotch and soda, "We said, 'What if,'" Mr. Furlaud said. 

   Negotiations began with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. advising Bristol-Myers and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. advising Squibb. 

   Insiders at the companies said the deal was possible because Messrs. 
Furlaud and Gelb have known each other for years and like and respect one another. 
Both are widely respected at their companies as firm but benevolent administrators who put a lot of trust in managers who are aggressive and willing to take chances. 

   In making the deal, Mr. Furlaud, who has been chief executive of Squibb since 1968, will relinquish his position as the longest-reigning chief executive in the industry. 
The mantle will pass to Mr. Gelb, who has headed Bristol-Myers since 1972.

   The first indictments stemming from the government investigation of alleged futures trading fraud here are expected as early as next week, according to defense lawyers. 

   Lawyers speculated that the government still hasn't determined how many traders to indict initially, although lawyers' estimates ranged from a total of 10 to more than 20 on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
Subsequent rounds of indictments are expected, the lawyers say. 

   Moreover, the Justice Department also could take the unprecedented step of naming entire futures trading pits as "racketeering enterprises" on the two exchanges, the lawyers said. 
Identifying trading pits in this manner enables the government to bring fraud charges against traders in the pits under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO law, lawyers said. 

   Since the government's investigation was first disclosed six months ago, an air of uncertainty has hung over the futures markets here -- with little word of any developments for several months. 
But that may be about to change. 
In recent days a flurry of contacts between prosecutors and defense attorneys suggests indictments may be imminent. 

   "I'm getting ready for the sky to fall in next week," said one lawyer with several futures trading clients at both exchanges. 
He and others stressed, however, that prosecutors haven't told them an exact date for the indictments. 
And some attorneys still thought that the indictments could be weeks, rather than days, away. 

   In fact, prosecutors could be ready to ask a grand jury for indictments and then hold off for several days or more if they thought a delay might induce traders who are targets of the investigation to cooperate. 

   Bolstering the theory that RICO charges will be brought was the appearance in Chicago of Paul Coffey, a senior officer in the Justice Department's criminal division who must approve all RICO indictments. 
Mr. Coffey is expected to meet here today with lawyers for traders who are targets of the investigation to hear their arguments as to why their clients shouldn't be hit with RICO charges. 
Mr. Coffey, reached at the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago, wouldn't comment. 

   Under RICO, the government can seek harsher penalties -- including the seizure of assets and profits earned via the alleged illicit pattern of activities -- than if it were charging traders with separate instances of fraud. 
But by naming a trading pit as a racketeering enterprise, the government wouldn't be charging every trader in the pit with fraud. 
Rather, it would allege that the traders it indicts used the pit as a vehicle for making fraudulent trades. 

   Critics argue that the RICO law shouldn't be brought in many instances of alleged white collar crime, including futures trading fraud. 

   It's highly unlikely the exchanges themselves would be implicated in any charges, lawyers said. 
Both exchanges have said that the investigations on their floors appear to be limited to a relatively small number of their members. 

   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas has declined to comment on all aspects of the two-year sting operation, in which federal agents posed as traders on both the Chicago Merc and the CBOT. 
The government investigation of futures traders on the two Chicago exchanges surfaced in mid-January as government agents made late night appearances at the homes of dozens of futures traders to deliver subpoenas. 

   Naming entire pits as RICO enterprises would do much more than tarnish the images of the exchanges, whose regulatory abilities have been questioned in light of the government investigation of trading on their floors. 
Defense lawyers said it would mean that traders in a given pit could be indicted and tried together even if they didn't all trade with each other. 
Although lawyers could be expected to move for separate trials for individual clients, defense lawyers said they'd have little chance of getting such motions approved. 

   "They'd all be on trial together, and all tainted by the evidence against everybody else," said one defense attorney. 

   Defense attorneys said they see Mr. Coffey's meetings here as a way for the government to avoid dealing with a stream of defense attorneys trekking to Washington for their clients. 
Several attorneys said they had exercised their right to request a conference in advance of any decision by the department on whether to approve RICO charges. 

   Defense attorneys said they plan to argue that it's inappropriate to charge their clients under the RICO statute. 
But they admitted this would be difficult because the U.S. Attorney's office still hasn't told them its evidence or legal theories in the case. 

   Indeed, some defense attorneys said they see the meeting as more of ploy by the government to show it at least listened to their arguments before pursuing indictments. 
"Frankly, I think RICO is a 'fait accompli'," said one defense attorney with clients at both exchanges. 
The initial indictments are seen as crucial to the government's overall case. 
"Whether major undercover projects are viewed ultimately as a success or failure has nothing to do with how good the project is," former U.S. Attorney Dan Webb said in a recent interview. 
"It has to do with whether you win or lose your first cases."

   Negotiations on cutting the capital-gains tax continued on Capitol Hill yesterday, but officials said no compromise was reached. 

   In yesterday's talks, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) met with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Budget Director Richard Darman. 

   Cutting the tax is a top priority of President Bush, but it is also anathema to Democratic leaders. 
So while a capital-gains cut appears to have the support of a majority of the committee, House Democratic leaders continue to put obstacles in the way of such legislation. 

   After yesterday's talks, Mr. Rostenkowski indicated that there hadn't been any progress. 
Administration officials said talks will continue. 

   House Democrats have suggested, as an alternative to cutting the tax rate on capital gains, reducing the taxable value of capital gains by an inflation index. 
A possibility being widely discussed was applying to capital gains an index for inflation, plus one percentage point -- a suggestion that last evening was derided by top House Democrats as tantamount to a rate cut. 

   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said yesterday there wasn't any need to rush things in the committee, and Chairman Rostenkowski hasn't scheduled the committee to meet again on the issue. 

   In addition, Joe Moakley (D., Mass.), chairman of the House Rules Committee, said in an interview he "would not be inclined to allow" a vote on the House floor for a provision that cut the capital gains tax. 
But he added he hadn't yet consulted with other House leaders. 

   The House Budget Committee chairman, Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), said he had asked Rep. Rostenkowski to drop the section of his tax bill to which the capital-gains cut would be attached. 
That would leave for a floor vote only the tax-increase and spending-cut parts of the bill intended to meet the requirements of the fiscal 1990 budget plan. 
Extraneous and controversial provisions such as a cut in the capital gains tax, Rep. Panetta said, "jeopardize the chances" for passing the deficit-reduction bill, which is scheduled to come to a vote in September. 

   In voting yesterday, the committee moved to make it harder to write off cellular telephones for tax purposes, and to use the additional revenue to reduce the taxes of the relatively few American companies that get all of their income from abroad. 

   As part of an effort to ease the complexity of the corporate alternative minimum tax, the tax-writing panel adopted a foreign-income amendment by Rep. Guy Vander Jagt (R., Mich.). 
The provision would permit companies that derive 100% of their income from foreign operations to use all of their available foreign tax credits to offset U.S. taxes under the minimum tax. 
Current law allows only 90% of the usable credits as an offset. 

   To pay for that change, Mr. Vander Jagt suggested, and the committee adopted by voice vote, a provision that would require cellular telephone owners to use their phones at least 50% of the time for business purposes in order to depreciate any of the expense. 
Currently, a cellular phone user can depreciate any portion that is used for business purposes. 
The provision wouldn't affect the deductibility of the cost of operating the increasingly popular mobile phones. 

   Mr. Vander Jagt said he knew of only two companies that would benefit from the minimum tax change. 
According to Kenneth Kies, a former Ways and Means staff member who now is a lobbyist, the two are Iron Ore Co. of Canada and Wabush Iron Ore Co. 
"We assume there are others, but we don't know how many," he said. 

   In contrast, at the end of last year there were 2.1 million subscribers to cellular telephone services, 85% for businesses. 
By 1992, there are expected to be about four million subscribers. 

   Asked about the panel's method of paying for the change on foreign income, Robert Maher, president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, said, "I would rather it had been done a different way."

   Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said he was convinced after three days of congressional hearings into ethical conduct and standards at the IRS that improvements need to be made at the agency. 

   Testifying before the House Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee, Mr. Goldberg pledged to take a hard look at the way the agency investigates allegations of wrongdoing among its employees. 
He said he has already recommended several changes to improve that "inspection" system. 

   "It is clear that we can improve the inspection function, and we will improve the inspection function," said Mr. Goldberg, who became commissioner July 4. 

   Mr. Goldberg ardently defended the overall integrity of the 120,000-employee IRS, which will collect over $1 trillion in taxes this year. 
"These hearings have focused on several specific instances of bad judgment, misconduct and possible criminal wrongdoing," he said. 
"They have not addressed the exemplary conduct and accomplishments of more than 120,000 dedicated, capable and honorable IRS employees." 

   The hearings follow a yearlong investigation by the subcommittee focusing on eight cases of alleged misconduct by 25 IRS senior employees in offices across the country. 
These include incidents in which high-level employees allegedly accepted gratuities and provided confidential tax information and one case in which an IRS official improperly intervened in a Justice Department examination as a favor to a friend. 

   During three all-day subcommittee hearings, a number of current and former employees also told the panel they were intimidated and harassed by superiors after reporting misconduct by colleagues. 
The subcommittee contends that the IRS was lax in investigating most of the cases. 
In the first day of hearings, subcommittee investigators said only one of the individuals involved had been punished; IRS officials said many of them left the agency before the investigations were concluded. 
IRS officials also said that most of the cases have been referred to the Justice Department. 

   Meanwhile, Rep. Bill Alexander (D., Ark.) accused the IRS of blocking efforts to investigate an alleged drugs-for-arms operation between Mena, Ark., and Central America from 1984 to 1986. 
Mr. Alexander said two congressional committees and law enforcement officials had sought access to William Duncan, then a veteran IRS agent who was investigating a money-laundering scheme linked to the alleged operation. 
The lawmaker said the IRS wouldn't cooperate. 

   Mr. Duncan, the agent, later told the lawmakers that he had received an unsubstantiated telephone tip involving possible bribery of a high government official connected to the case. 
He said an IRS attorney told him to withhold that information when he was called to testify before Congress last year. 
IRS officials disputed Mr. Duncan's claims, and the agent eventually did testify. 
But he said the matter led him to quit the agency. 

   Subcommittee members may push to increase oversight of the vast tax-collecting agency, possibly by transferring responsibility for some policing from the agency itself to the office of the Treasury Department's inspector general or by creating a separate IRS inspector general appointed by the president. 

   But former IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs and Senior Deputy Commissioner Michael Murphy told the committee that would be a mistake. 
Mr. Gibbs said having political appointees police the IRS could open the way for political manipulation and misuse such as that which occurred in the 1970s, when the Nixon administration used private tax information to go after political enemies. 

   Mr. Goldberg said he had no opinion yet on the issue. 

   Mr. Goldberg said the IRS is installing an improved computer system to investigate alleged abuses by employees. 
The agency also plans to set up a hotline for employees to report misconduct directly to IRS headquarters in Washington rather than to inspectors in local offices who may be too close to the subjects they are supposed to investigate. 
He also promised to review the training of inspection officials. 

   Mr. Goldberg added, "I will not tolerate harassment of whistleblowers." 

   Subcommittee members intend to continue their hearings in September. 
And they seem to think the agency has a huge task ahead. 

   After Mr. Murphy defended the agency's integrity and described the agency's successes in punishing wrongdoing, Rep. Doug Barnard (D., Ga.), the subcommittee chairman, angrily retorted, "The IRS world you describe, where wrongdoings are systematically punished and whistleblowers are applauded, is an IRS world I don't recognize, not from our investigations. 

   "The real {IRS} world," the lawmaker added, "is where employees are afraid to come forward because of retaliation. 
The real world of IRS is where if you're not a team player, you're off the team. 
I do not agree with your characterization of the IRS one bit."

@  Homing In on Shared Down Payments

   Used to be, young couples who didn't have enough saved up for a down payment on a house would turn to their relatives for help. 

   These days, total strangers are stepping in to provide the cash by investing in "shared-equity" mortgages. 
In return for putting up some or all of the down payment for cash-strapped home buyers, the investors get to share in any increase in the value of the house, and sometimes additional fees, as well. 

   Individual investors have been raking in big profits in the past two or three years with shared-equity mortgages in some parts of the country where housing prices have soared. 

   Now brokers and mortgage companies are eagerly signing up additional investors to match up with prospective home buyers. 
Two private limited partnerships have been launched to pool investors' money. 

   But while some people have done well, shared-equity mortgages also present plenty of pitfalls. 

   "Investors are betting on escalating home prices and the ability of their partners to make the monthly mortgage payments," says Michael Evans, chairman of Arthur Young &amp; Co.'s national real-estate advisory group. 
"Real-estate prices don't go up forever, and in a slowing economy some people lose their jobs and can't make the mortgage payments. 
You could get stuck with a house in a collapsing market." 

   Shared-equity mortgages were popular in 1979 and 1980, when mortgage interest rates and housing prices both were skyhigh. 
But the mortgages disappeared in 1982, when interest rates dropped. 

   Today they've re-emerged as an answer to the severe affordability problem faced by hopeful home buyers in some of the country's hottest real-estate markets. 
In Orange County, Calif., for instance, the price of a "no frills" entry-level home has climbed to $260,000. 
"It's hard even for a couple making $60,000 a year each to save up enough for a down payment," says Mr. Evans. 

   Many of the people investing in shared-equity mortgages are refugees from investing in rental apartments. 
Elaine St. James, a Santa Barbara, Calif., investor who has purchased 10 equity-sharing mortgages, says she switched because she was "tired of hassles with tenants." 

   Jesse Vint, a Herndon, Va., airline pilot, who has invested in four equity-sharing mortgages in the past 11 months, says his rental apartment investment was "a nightmare." 
But he figures he'll get an annual return of about 24% on his shared-equity investments -- assuming the houses appreciate about 6% a year and none of the buyers default. 
"I can't think of a better investment for me," he says. 

   Whether a shared-equity mortgage actually is a good deal for an investor depends a lot on the local real-estate market. 
"If you had a shared-equity mortgage in New Jersey, in the past 18 months you would have been killed as prices dropped 25%," says Stanley Zimmerman, president of the Mortgage Institute of California. 
"Yet in Southern California, you would have done very well, since prices went up 30%." 

   Moreover, just because a particular housing market has been booming doesn't mean investors can count on a continuing price surge. 
For example, Mr. Zimmerman says he believes the fast inflation in California home prices is over. 

   Even within markets, prices and prospects can vary greatly. 
As a result, financial advisers say investors contemplating a shared-equity mortgage should carry their research down to the neighborhood where the house is located. 

   It's mandatory that investors talk to their own accountants and attorneys before becoming involved, the advisers say. 

   Each shared-equity mortgage should be examined carefully, because details of the arrangements differ. 
Here are a few of the permutations: 

   --Equitymaker Partners Ltd., Reston, Va., matches investors with home buyers. 
The investor puts up a 10% down payment. 
The buyer pays closing costs and other expenses, makes the monthly mortgage payments and pays for all home maintenance. 
The buyer also gets all tax deductions from the home. 

   The agreement lasts for three to five years. 
At that time, either party can buy out the other, or the property will be sold to someone else. 
After the amount of the down payment is returned to the investor, the mortgage is retired and the sales commission is paid, the investor and the person selling the house split the appreciation equally. 
Officials of Equitymaker have also begun a "private" limited partnership (which is a partnership for a small group of wealthy individuals) to raise cash for more investments. 

   --Executive Properties, Santa Barbara, sets up equity-sharing arrangements where the investor and the home buyer divide the down payment, closing costs and appreciation. 
As part of the monthly mortgage payment, the buyer also pays the investor "rent." 
This allows the investor to claim an income-tax deduction for depreciation. 

   --CoEquity Corp., Costa Mesa, Calif., takes more of a debtor-creditor relationship with home buyers. 
In its shared-equity arrangements, the investor puts up a 10% down payment and half of the closing costs, including CoEquity's 3% to 5% matchmaking fee. 
The home buyer puts up the other half of the closing costs and fee, then pays interest at 12% a year to the investor. 
The buyer gets all of the tax deductions. 

   At the end of the agreement, which can last as long as seven years, the investor and the buyer split any appreciation equally. 
CoEquity also has begun a private limited partnership to raise additional funds. 

   David Toothill, a Santa Monica, Calif., software developer, has invested in 20 of the CoEquity shared-appreciation mortgages. 
"I've been in the program for three years, and the returns have been phenomenal, but I don't expect this rate to continue indefinitely," he says. 

   Mr. Toothill's investments also illustrate some potential problems. 
Of his 20 owner-occupant partners, there have been two divorces. 
One couple split after four months and the other after two years. 
In the first case, CoEquity returned Mr. Toothill's money. 
The second home is now on the market.

@ How Equity Sharing Works 

   Here's the way an investor's return would be calculated on one type of equity-sharing agreement. 
The example is based on the purchase of a $150,000 home, with the investor putting up a 10% down payment; the buyer pays closing costs and makes the payments on the $135,000 mortgage. 
The example assumes that the house appreciates by 7% a year for five years and is then sold. 
@Resale price of house after five years ......... $ 210,000 
@Less remaining mortgage principal .............. -131,700 
@Less costs of sale (8% of sales price) ......... - 16,800 
@Total equity ................................... 61,500 
@Less investor's down payment ................... - 15,000 
@Total shared equity (to be split 50-50 between 
@ investor and person selling the house) ...... 46,500 
@Investor's profit (compound annual average 
@ rate of return = 20.58%) .................... 23,250

   Crownx Inc. said it agreed to sell its Coronet Trust Co. unit to Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada. 

   Crownx declined to indicate the value of the proposed transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, but Winston Ling, Crownx executive vice president of finance, said it is higher than Coronet's book value of about 30 million Canadian dollars ($25.3 million). 

   Mr. Ling said Crownx was selling Coronet, a federally licensed Canadian trust company with assets of more than C$600 million, because it didn't fit in with Crownx's other financial-services businesses. 
Crownx, of Toronto, has interests in life-insurance, financial-services and health-care concerns. 

   Sun Life, also of Toronto, is a mutual-life-insurance company.

   Digital Equipment Corp., the world's second-largest computer maker, reported a 22% decline in net income for the fiscal fourth quarter and single-digit revenue growth for the first time since 1985. 

   The results fell somewhat short of expectations, though analysts were cheered that they weren't worse. 
"It wasn't a total disaster, so people are breathing a sigh of relief," said Jay P. Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 

   Digital's weaker results follow a series of setbacks to mid-range computer makers. 
Data General Corp., Prime Computer Inc. and Wang Laboratories Inc. all posted steep losses for their latest quarters. 

   For the quarter ended July 1, Digital's profit fell to $313.2 million, or $2.51 a share, from $401 million, or $3.08 a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 4.7% to $3.49 billion from $3.34 billion. 

   Citing continued "lackluster conditions" in domestic markets, Maynard, Mass.-based Digital also warned that it "remains cautious" about the revenue outlook for the current quarter. 
The uncertain outlook prompted some analysts to cut earnings estimates for the fiscal year that began July 2. 

   Nevertheless, Digital's stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $92.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. 

   Digital's president, Kenneth H. Olsen, said that while overseas revenue continued its double-digit growth, "business conditions in the U.S. are still somewhat slow, with fourth-quarter revenues similar to those of the same period a year ago, but up from the prior quarter." 

   The revenue increase from the previous quarter "confirms that the decline in domestic revenues has bottomed out," said Carol E. Muratore, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 
She said that recent increases in U.S. revenue reported by International Business Machines Corp. and by Tandem Computers Inc. "reverses the trend and shows that it's not just a bottomless pit." 

   Marc G. Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc., New York, said that "if you dig below the surface, there's cause for concern." 
He said Digital appeared to be expecting a slowdown in some European economies, where the company has long enjoyed strong sales growth. 

   Mr. Schulman cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year to $8.25 from $9. 
Dean Witter also lowered its estimate for the 1990 fiscal year to $8.70 from $9. 

   For the full year, Digital's profit fell 18% to $1.07 billion, or $8.45 a share, from $1.31 billion, or $9.90 a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 11% to $12.74 billion from $11.48 billion. 

   Until the latest fiscal year, Digital had been the fastest-growing major computer maker. 
The company had reported rapid growth in earnings and revenue from 1986 through 1988.

   Turbo Resources Ltd. said its board approved a shareholder rights plan intended to prevent anyone from gaining control of the company without making an offer to all shareholders. 

   The Calgary, Alberta, oil refining and marketing company also said it plans a 1-for-5 reverse split of its common shares and to change its name to Canadian Turbo Inc. 

   Turbo said the shareholder rights plan would be triggered if any party acquires 20.5% or more of its voting shares. 
Other holders would then be permitted to buy additional shares at 50% of market value. 
Turbo said the plan wouldn't be triggered if the acquirer made a bid for all the shares outstanding and the takeover was approved by a majority of the other holders at a special meeting. 

   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Turbo closed at 68 Canadian cents (57 U.S. cents), down six Canadian cents.

<DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. employees still refer to the auto maker's mass layoffs and near-bankruptcy of the early 1980s as the "dark days." 
Just yesterday, though, things got pretty gloomy again. 

   Chairman Lee Iacocca chose the quarterly meeting of his 600 top managers to break the bad news: Some 2,300 white-collar staffers -- 8% of the total salaried work force -- will lose their jobs in the next five months 

   "The car and truck business in the U.S. is undergoing a dramatic and permanent transformation that puts enormous pressures on all manufacturers to get their programs and costs in line," Mr. Iacocca said late yesterday. 
"This is not simply a reaction to the current sales environment." 

   Indeed, what's hitting Chrysler employees isn't just the well-publicized car-sales slump of 1989. 
So far, sales have dropped only 6.5% from 1988, the industry's second-best year. 

   Instead, what really has auto makers scrambling is that sales are dropping just when car-making capacity in North America is soaring. 
Though the first Japanese auto plant in the U.S. (Honda's) opened only six years ago, Japanese auto makers' U.S. production will reach one million cars and trucks this year. 
That could triple within five years, and total North American capacity could hit 16.3 million cars and trucks, estimates Autofacts Inc. of Paoli, Pa. 
Such increases would supply some 2.5 million vehicles more than likely demand -- equal to a full year's work for 10 assembly plants. 

   For years, auto makers have seen this problem coming, but only now is it hitting home. 
In the fourth quarter of this year, Detroit's Big Three will build 16% fewer cars than a year earlier. 
And Japanese car production in the U.S. will surge 41%, Ward's Automotive Reports says. 

   So Detroit faces the double-barreled blast: a cyclical slump and a structural upheaval likely to make the early 1990s almost as tumultuous as the early 1980s. 
But the U.S. auto industry isn't dying. 
Instead, it's increasingly moving into the hands of more effective managers -- the Japanese. 
Even they, however, aren't immune to the forces hitting Detroit. 
All auto makers, strong and weak alike, need to make fundamental changes. 

   High on the list is leaner staffing. 
Even before Chrysler's announcement yesterday, Saab-Scania of America had moved to cut its white-collar ranks 10%, some 55 people, through an early-retirement plan. 
The company's U.S. sales are running 26% behind those of two years ago. 

   On a vastly larger scale, General Motors Corp. is facing wrenching decisions about how many plants and employees it must sacrifice. 
For nearly three years, GM has been on a corporate crash diet, shedding factories and workers alike. 
But it's far from enough. 
GM has repeatedly idled factories this year and seems to have four car-assembly plants more than it needs. 

   (GM and Ford Motor Co. reported lower second-quarter earnings yesterday. 
GM's net income fell 3.5% and Ford's 15%.) 

   Even strong companies, such as Honda, must move aggressively to fix weak spots. 
Honda's cars have been so well regarded that it has long disdained the rebates and other incentives to which lesser auto makers turn repeatedly. 
But recently the car that sells itself saw its first sales discounts, and its dealers are scrambling to become salesmen instead of simply order takers. 

   Despite the problems, the car business isn't all bleak. 
Slump or no slump, buyers still snap up cars that are smartly designed and crisply executed. 
One bit of evidence: Mazda Motor Co.'s hot little Miata MX-5, a sporty two-seat convertible with neo-classic styling and a modest ($13,800) base price that recalls the popular British MG and Triumph roadsters of two decades ago. 
Increasingly, auto makers will be eyeing such niche products. 

   Here's a look at the various ways auto makers will tackle the bumps ahead: 

   Slimming Down 

   Chrysler's latest cutbacks stem from a simple problem: When times got good, the company got fat. 
In 1983, when the auto maker was still recovering from near-bankruptcy, it had some 20,000 white-collar workers, half as many as five years before. 
But now, its white-collar ranks have ballooned to 31,000. 

   Much of this was the by-product of Chrysler's 1987 acquisition of American Motors Corp. and its hot-selling Jeep line. 
Chrysler also has expanded its finance operations. 
However, Chrysler's world-wide sales in the first half of this year fell 10.5% from a year earlier, while its world-wide work force as of May was up 6% from the 1988 average. 
At that rate, Chrysler could sell fewer than 16 vehicles per worker world-wide this year, compared with about 19 per worker in 1986. 

   But as it slashes costs, Chrysler says it won't hobble product development, an area it can ill afford to cut. 
The company simply hasn't had the resources to develop a broad array of state-of-the-art vehicles. 
Its main subcompact car is 11 years old, and weak sales are keeping the plant that builds it on one shift. 
Just yesterday, Chrysler doubled the rebates on those Omni and Horizon subcompacts to $1,500 -- a whopping 23% discount. 
Such discounting put more pressure on its minivans and Jeeps to generate profit, but those lines are about to be bombarded by new competitors. 

   So, Chrysler is looking for allies that can bolster its product lines. 
Already, it has agreed to buy a low-cost midsized car from Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. 
And it is negotiating with France's Regie Nationale des Usines Renault to jointly build a compact Jeep. 

   GM's problem, meanwhile, is that it can build almost one million more cars in North America than it can sell. 
Huge investments aren't earning their keep. 
A prime example: GM's assembly plant in Doraville, Ga., which is producing barely half the cars it's capable of building. 
In the early 1980s, the plant made cars for three different GM divisions. 
If one division's model didn't sell, the plant kept running by building more of the other cars. 

   Three years ago, that all changed. 
Doraville was selected to build a new line of midsized coupes, code-named "GM-10" and costing $5 billion to develop. 
The plant was outfitted with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of robots and other automated, flexible-production equipment. 
But each of the four plants in the program was assigned to build just one division's model; Doraville got the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. 
GM figured that that would improve quality, and it planned on selling enough of each model to keep all four plants humming. 

   But last year, Oldsmobile sold just 116,000 Supremes, and this year's sales are running 6% behind even that lackluster pace. 
GM is using barely half of Doraville's capacity of 260,000 cars a year. 
The plant's robots and 4,000 workers have been idle for 12 of the first 27 weeks of this year. 
The other plants in the GM-10 program are posting similar records. 

   The one-plant, one-product strategy "is a terrible mistake in a market so volatile," says John Krafcik of the International Motor Vehicle Program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
"These are billion-dollar plants, costing 30% to 40% more than a Japanese plant. 
They've got a tremendous capacity to do two or three different models, but instead they focus on one." 

   This mistake would have destroyed most auto makers. 
GM is merely suffering -- and hunting for a cure. 
It is adding four-door sedans to the GM-10 line. 
It is converting two auto plants to truck production, closing a car plant in Framingham, Mass., this summer, and planning to squeeze production of one of its large-car lines into two assembly plants instead of three. 
But industry analysts estimate that GM will have to close as many as four more plants to keep its pledge to use 100% of its assembly capacity by 1992. 

   Shoring Up Weak Spots 

   Because the auto industry's good times rolled on so long, each company assumed that when the crunch came, the other guy would get hurt. 
That was especially true of Honda. 
For years, while rivals dangled $1,500 rebates and interest-free loans before buyers, Honda stood above it all. 
It effortlessly sold all the cars it could make in the U.S. and all it could ship from Japan. 

   No longer. 
In April, after its first-quarter sales slipped 6%, Honda gave dealers a modest allowance ranging from $100 to $300 a car. 
This month, the company weighed in with more money. 
Though still shunning direct rebates to consumers, it is offering dealers up to $500 for each Prelude and $350 for each Accord sedan. 
They can use the money to cut their prices. 

   "When demand exceeded supply, there was never any reason for incentives," says Thomas G. Elliott, executive vice president of Honda's U.S. sales arm. 
Now, he concedes, "we have growing capacity, other manufacturers have growing capacity, and there are a lot of cars looking for homes." 

   So Honda, despite all its strengths, must make more changes. 
When demand seemed endless, Honda never had to fine-tune its distribution system. 
Urban areas still get too many models equipped with manual transmissions, which drivers in stop-and-go traffic dislike. 
Dealers in wide-open rural areas get too few manuals. 
Dealers in cities where insurance is costly get too many racy CRX models, which draw high premiums. 
Dealers would sometimes have to swap whole truckloads of cars to get models their customers wanted. 

   "These are frustrating problems Honda has never encountered here before," says John J. Pohanka, a Washington, D.C., dealer who owns both Honda and GM franchises. 
"But to keep up with the game, these issues have to be addressed." 

   Indeed, Honda can ill afford to stumble in the U.S. 
This fall, it will open its second assembly plant in Ohio and thus must buck a declining market to eventually raise its U.S. sales, including imports, from its current 800,000 cars a year to one million. 
Much is riding on an all-new Accord, Honda's bread-and-butter car, which goes on sale this fall. 

   Ford, like Honda, holds a strong position. 
But after nearly six years without a factory shutdown, Ford has idled nine North American assembly plants so far this year for a total of 25 weeks. 
So it recently scrapped one of its most ambitious projects ever: a new family of trucks and vans to be built on the same base chassis. 
The projected $5 billion cost had dwarfed the $3.1 billion spent to develop the Taurus/Sable cars. 

   "We're re-examining everything we said we'd do to see if we can do without some {new} cars or trucks," one Ford executive says. 
"When you start earning less money and closing plants, you have to rethink your priorities." 

   And despite its huge prosperity in recent years, Ford still lags behind Japanese auto makers in costs, quality and, especially, engine and transmission technology. 
It is already spending billions of dollars on a crash catch-up effort. 
That's why, despite cutting the truck program, Ford's automotive capital spending soared 55% in the 1989 second quarter. 

   Seeking Niches 

   For years, Mazda tried to get along in the U.S. as a discount version of Honda or Toyota. 
Now, it has a new strategy: "Attack the market where it's weakest," says George McCabe, sales and marketing chief at Mazda's U.S. sales arm. 

   Earlier this month, Mazda brought out the Miata MX-5, a car so popular that it's now commanding as much as $4,000 over the sticker price. 
"It was a stroke of genius on Mazda's part," says Christopher Cedergren, an analyst at J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a market-research firm. 

   It was also a stroke of luck. 
In 1988, GM killed its similarly priced Pontiac Fiero, thus opening the market for inexpensive, sporty two-seaters. 
Mazda's ability to exploit that opening illustrates how crucial manufacturing flexibility and market agility will be in the 1990s. 

   GM killed the Fiero because it had dedicated a full-scale factory to producing the plastic-bodied car, and that plant couldn't run profitably when Fiero sales fell below 50,000 a year. 
But Mazda expects to make money selling no more than 40,000 Miatas a year. 
That's because Mazda builds the rear-wheel-drive Miata on the same Hiroshima assembly line as four other vehicles, including a front-wheel-drive subcompact and a minivan. 

   Thus, Mazda now has a chance to sell an extra 40,000 cars a year. 
One Pontiac official says with a sigh: "The Fiero could have been a Miata."

@  Making Changes
@  In DC-10 Design

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. disclosed that it's leaning toward making design changes to the DC-10, although it strenuously defended the aircraft's safety record. 

   The acknowledgment came as the second DC-10 in eight days crashed, killing scores of people, and an airline passenger advocacy group petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration to consider grounding the fleet. 

   The accident occurred early yesterday morning when a Korean Air tri-jet fell short of the airport in Tripoli, Libya, sending flaming wreckage cartwheeling through an olive grove. 
The Associated Press reported last night that at least 82 people had died. 

   Fog is believed to have played a part in the accident, which apparently has no connection to last week's DC-10 crash in Sioux City, Iowa. 
In that disaster, in which 111 were killed, the engine in the plane's tail exploded, crippling key control lines. 

   At a hastily convened news conference at its Douglas Aircaft unit here, company officials proudly reeled off a catalog of DC-10 statistics: 1,000 flights daily, more than seven billion miles in the air since July 1971, 745 million passengers carried by the aircraft. 
They also stressed that until Sioux City, the DC-10 fleet had flown eight million flight hours without a fatal accident-longer than any other type of major airliner. 

   But Dale Warren, a Douglas Aircraft vice president and engineer, said while it's too soon to tell what will happen to the DC10, the St. Louis-based company is prepared to make alterations if it's determined that they're needed. 
"It would appear at this time, some action is appropriate," he said. 

   Among the 10 or so options being considered: strengthening the casing of the engine, which is made by General Electric Co.; better insulating of the DC-10's three hydraulic systems, which provide pressure to move the flaps that steer the jet; and inserting special valves near the rear engine, which would shut and keep fluid in the hydraulic lines if they're severed. 
In a front-page story earlier this week, this newspaper noted that the hydraulic systems on other planes have such valves, as well as other protections the DC-10 lacks. 

   The last of 446 DC-10s was assembled earlier this year and is set to be delivered within the next few days to Nigeria Airways. 
Thus, any modifications would be made to planes already in service. 
The first MD-11, the three-engine successor to the DC-10, is set to be delivered in the fall of 1990, at the earliest. 

   Analysts said if some design change is eventually undertaken, it probably wouldn't make much of a financial dent in McDonnell Douglas. 
They pointed out that Boeing Co. tinkered with its 747 jumbo jet after a Japan Air Lines crash in 1985, with little effect on the bottom line. 
"For companies this size," said Jerry Cantwell, of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., "it's nickles and dimes." 

   Mr. Warren and Knick Knickerbocker, the company's chief of flight operations, emphasized that they consider the DC-10 a safe plane. 
They said the engine failure that triggered last week's accident was unusually massive, adding that the hydraulic systems were damaged in three separate spots as much as eight feet apart. 

   Mr. Warren especially took issue with contentions by the International Airline Passengers Association, a Washington-based organization, that the DC-10 has "inherent design flaws." 
He termed the group's appeal to the FAA "unfortunate and distressing."

   A group including Unicorp Canada Corp. said it is raising its offer for all the shares of Steinberg Inc. it doesn't already own to about 1.26 billion Canadian dollars ($1.07 billion U.S.) from C$1.27 billion, setting the stage for a war of nerves with rival bidder Socanav Inc. 

   The group, Oxdon Investments Inc., said it is increasing its offer for Steinberg Class A shares to C$53 from C$50 a share. 
It said it doesn't plan to change its C$75-a-share offer for Steinberg common shares. 
Steinberg family members and associates hold 87% of the common. 

   Socanav, backed by the Quebec government's pension fund agency, Caisse de Depot et Placement, plans to offer C$75 for each Steinberg common share and C$51 for each Steinberg Class A share. 
Steinberg, a Montreal real estate and food retailer, is about 20 times larger than Socanav, a small Montreal shipping concern. 

   Socanav wouldn't comment on Oxdon's plan to raise its bid. 
But a Caisse de Depot spokeswoman said Socanav will make its bid as planned at C$75 a common share and C$51 for each Class A share. 

   Socanav holds an exclusive option to acquire a 52% voting stake in Steinberg from a Steinberg family group. 
Socanav must make a bid of at least C$75 a common share and C$51 a Class A share by midnight July 31 to exercise the option. 
A lawyer for the Steinberg family group wouldn't say if a higher offer by Socanav would void the option agreement. 

   Oxdon could block Socanav from taking Steinberg private if it acquires enough shares to end up holding at least 33.3% of Steinberg's Class A stock. 

   Steinberg's board conditionally recommended the original Oxdon bid in the absence of a firm Socanav bid or a higher competing bid. 
Oxdon said because Steinberg's board supports a cash bid, it will offer only cash to holders. 
Previously, it offered a choice of cash or securities. 

   To finance the increased bid, Oxdon said its shareholders agreed to commit an additional C$250 million to the company. 
Oxdon is owned equally by Unicorp Canada's Kingsbridge Capital Group unit, Oxford Development Group Inc. and Gordon Investment Corp., all of Toronto.

   Sea Containers Ltd. had a setback in court in its efforts to thwart a $50-a-share hostile takeover bid. 

   Temple Holdings Ltd. said a federal court in Washington, D.C., denied Sea Containers' motion for a preliminary injunction to block Temple from proceeding with its $777 million tender offer. 
As a result of the court's decision, Temple said it remains free to pursue a merger. 

   Sea Containers, a Bermuda-based equipment-leasing and shipping concern, didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the decision. 

   Temple is an affiliate of Stena Holding AG -- a unit of Stena AB of Sweden -- and Tiphook PLC, based in London.

   Anchor Savings Bank said its fiscal fourth-quarter net loss widened sharply, largely because of the adverse impact of interest rates on its net interest yields, market losses on its high-yield security portfolio, and provisions for credit losses. 

   The Hewlett, N.Y., thrift's loss widened to $26.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, from $14.8 million a year earlier. 

   The company also said the quarter included charges associated with restructuring activities. 
Nonperforming assets fell to 0.82% of total assets from 0.96% a year earlier. 
The bank increased its allowance for credit losses to $20.1 million in the quarter from $17.9 million a year ago. 

   "As a result of recent management actions and the recent decline in interest rates, gradual improvement is likely to continue," said James M. Large Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. 
But "further negative one-time adjustments" may be necessary "as the restructuring continues." 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Anchor closed at $4.25 a share, down 12.5 cents.

   Armco Inc., buoyed from extraordinary gains from its joint venture, said second-quarter net income nearly doubled to $75.6 million, or 84 cents a share. 

   In the year-earlier quarter, the steelmaker earned $39.7 million, or 43 cents a share, including a $15 million charge related to the discontinued insurance operations. 
Quarter sales, however, fell 20% to $665.6 million from $826.7 million. 

   The latest-quarter's results include gains of $112.3 million as a result of completing a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp. of Japan and $15 million from a favorable ruling on certain foreign-export commitments. 
Earnings also included restructuring charges of $40.4 million and $45 million in charges related to Armco's discontinued insurance operations. 

   Armco benefited from relatively strong demand for carbon, stainless and electrical steel through much of the second quarter, although the company said it noticed softening late in the period. 
Armco said even though it "anticipates a seasonal slowdown in steel shipments for the third quarter, inventory reductions in the second half will reduce shipments further." 

   Armco's carbon-steel segment recorded operating profit of $143 million on sales of $348.5 million, including the gain from the sale of 40% of the business and net assets of Eastern Steel Division to Kawasaki Steel. 
Last year, that division had an operating profit of $50.1 million on sales of $504.6 million. 

   Operating profit in the specialty-steels business dropped to $18.5 million from $23.7 million a year ago, as a result of production problems and lower prices for steel products. 
Sales also dropped to $246.1 million from $254.8 million. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Armco closed at $10.75 a share, down 37.5 cents.

   Fairfield Communities Inc., Little Rock, Ark., said it reached an agreement with Atlantic Group Inc. that prohibits Atlantic from buying more Fairfield stock and gives Atlantic access to confidential Fairfield information. 

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Atlantic said it had discussed with Fairfield and other parties the possibility of a "business combination transaction" with Fairfield, a builder and developer of retirement and recreational communities. 
Atlantic, a Jacksonville, Fla., retailer and distributor of natural foods and vitamins, said it wasn't certain a proposal would be made. 

   Marcel Dumeny, Fairfield senior vice president, said he didn't know of any specific agreements or ventures under discussion by the companies. 
He said the new agreement barred Atlantic and its affiliated investors, for two years, from increasing their holdings in Fairfield stock. 

   An investor group including Atlantic, has owned about 18% of Fairfield's common since September 1988 when Atlantic said it was interested in acquiring a "substantial equity position" in Fairfield.

   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., Kirland, Wash., said Drexel Burnham Lambert will provide as much as $2.5 billion for McCaw's proposed acquisition of LIN Broadcasting Corp. 

   McCaw said Drexel indicated in a letter it is "highly confident" that based on current conditions, it can arrange $2.5 billion of financing "either privately or publicly." 
McCaw said the agreement with Drexel makes it confident it can complete financing "on a timely basis." 

   In the testy relations between LIN and McCaw, New York-based LIN has expressed concern over McCaw's financing. 
McCaw, the nation's largest cellular-phone concern, has offered $110 a share in cash for LIN, which holds valuable cellular franchises in several major cities. 
The bid values LIN at about $5.96 billion. 
LIN has rejected the offer as inadequate. 

   Earlier this week, LIN set a July 31 deadline for completing a definitive agreement, and said it considers $127.50 a share a fair price. 
McCaw responded to that yesterday in a letter to LIN Chairman Donald Pels, stating McCaw believes its $110-aashare offer is "full and fair."

   Salem Corp.'s management has declined to announce a shareholder meeting scheduled for next Monday, according to Edward Marshall, a Beverly Hills, Calif., real-estate developer and owner of 2.2% of Salem's 1.2 million common shares outstanding. 
The Pittsburgh-based company makes heavy equipment for the metal and coal industries; the annual meeting was called by Mr. Marshall. 

   "But a meeting will be held, anyway," Mr. Marshall said, adding: "There will at least be a meeting of concerned shareholders of Salem." 

   As previously reported, Mr. Marshall exercised his right under Pennsylvania law to call an annual meeting of shareholders. 
He said Salem has not had an annual shareholders' meeting since 1985. 

   Mr. Marshall is trying to force Salem to buy out its chairman and chief executive officer, Miami investor Victor Posner, whom he contends "is not running the company in what you would call a normal manner." 

   Salem's management has refused Mr. Marshall's request for a list of Salem's shareholders.

   American Electric Power Co. named five new operating-company presidents in what is believed the biggest management reshuffling in the company's 84-year history. 
Triggering the changes are the retirements of several operating chiefs. 

   The new appointees, averaging 47 years in age, include the youngest unit-president ever. 
He is 36-year-old James M. Allison, who will become president and chief operating officer of Wheeling Power Co., effective Oct. 1. 

   Mr. Allison, who has been South Bend, Ind., division manager of Indiana Michigan Power Co., succeeds Thomas R. McCaffrey, 50, who becomes president and chief operating officer of Columbus Southern Power Co. here, effective Oct. 1. 
He succeeds William J. Lhota, 49, who has been named executive vice president, operations, for the AEP Service Corp. unit. 

   Also named: 

   --Joseph H. Vipperman, 48, who has been in the AEP Service Corp. position being assumed by Mr. Lhota, as president and chief operating officer of Appalachian Power Co., effective Jan. 1. 
Mr. Vipperman, who will be executive vice president at Appalachian Power until he assumes the top spot there, succeeds John W. Vaughan, who is retiring Jan. 1 at age 65. 

   --Richard C. Menge, 54, senior vice president of Indiana Michigan Power, who will become president and chief operating officer of the Fort Wayne, Ind., unit Oct. 1. 
He succeeds William A. Black, who is retiring at 65. 

   --Coulter R. Boyle III, 41, vice president at Kentucky Power Co since 1987, elevated to head the Ashland, Ky., unit beginning May 1, 1990. 
He will succeed Robert E. Matthews, who will retire May 1 at 65. 

   "We are fortunate to have been able to develop the management breadth needed in the 1990s," said AEP Chairman W.S. White Jr., 62, in announcing the changes. 
AEP has eight operating companies. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, AEP closed at $30.125, up 12.5 cents.

   Alaska dropped its investigation into possible criminal wrongdoing by Exxon Corp. and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. in connection with the Valdez oil spill. 

   Exxon and Alyeska, the consortium that operates the Trans-Alaska pipeline and its tanker-loading terminal, remain subjects of a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
The state also is continuing its preparations for civil litigation and is expected to file soon a massive lawsuit against one or both of the companies. 
But Larry Weeks, head of the Alaska state attorney office's criminal division, said the state concluded that it doesn't have the money or the statutes to justify a prolonged criminal probe. 

   Last March 24, some 11 million gallons of oil spilled from the supertanker Exxon Valdez when it ran aground in Prince William Sound. 

   Mr. Weeks said his office's preliminary investigation indicated that the most serious criminal charges the state was likely to bring against Exxon or Alyeska would have been misdemeanors under state law, punishable only by fines of as much as $100,000. 
He said that federal laws that may apply to the same types of activities are felonies that carry fines of as much as triple the dollar amount of environmental damage. 
To date, neither Exxon nor Alyeska has been charged with any criminal wrongdoing. 

   "The costs of the investigation would have been enormous, and we didn't feel it would be worth it. . . .trying to get misdemeanor convictions," he said. 
"The federal government has more resources and better laws that make it more appropriate for them to deal with any possible criminal violations," he added. 

   Exxon declined to comment; Alyeska couldn't be reached for comment. 
But some state officials saw the decision as a break for the companies. 
Because of widespread outrage in Alaska over the spill and the companies' ineffective containment and clean-up efforts, some state officials say, Alaska might have been in a position to pursue the companies more aggressively for both civil and criminal damages. 
They suggested that the federal government might be subject to political pressure to ease up somewhat in the interest of national energy policy. 
"Exxon and the oil industry have many friends in Washington and not very many in Alaska anymore," said one state official. 

   The state is still pursuing its criminal investigation of Joseph Hazlewood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez at the time it ran aground. 
The state has charged Capt. Hazlewood with operating a vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge. 
All the charges are misdemeanors. 
Together, they carry maximum penalties of 27 months in jail and $11,000 in fines. 
His trial is scheduled for October.

   A partnership owned by a Unicorp Canada Corp. merchant-banking unit and food retailer Cara Operations Ltd. said it extended its $43-a-share tender offer for Dunkin' Donuts' shares to midnight Aug. 11. 

   Cara and Kingsbridge Capital Group, who formed DD Acquisition Corp. to make the bid, said they are awaiting a court decision in their challenge of Dunkin' Donuts' employee stock ownership plan and its stock issue to General Electric Capital Corp., a unit of General Electric Co. 

   Dunkin' Donuts, which rejected the tender offer as inadequate, values it at $256 million. 
In national over-the-counter trading, Dunkin' Donuts closed at $38 a share, down 12.5 cents. 

   DD Acquisition said that at the close of business yesterday, 1,611,593 Dunkin' Donuts common shares, representing about 28.1% of the shares outstanding, had been tendered or committed to its offer. 
Kingsbridge Capital currently owns about 15% of Dunkin' Donuts' common shares, excluding those tendered to its offer.

   Aluminum Co. of America, citing shortage of alumina because of a strike at its partially owned alumina refinery in Jamaica, said it will idle a 42,000-metric-ton-a-year potline at Wenatchee, Wa. 

   The move accelerates Alcoa's plan to curtail aluminum production and is expected to add more upward pressure on the price of aluminum. 

   The potline, which makes primary aluminum from alumina, is one of five at the plant, the Pittsburgh company said. 
Aluminum products, such as beverage cans and foils, are made from primary aluminum. 

   The action follows a walk-out Saturday by 600 workers at the Clarendon alumina refinery, a 50-50 partnership of Alcoa and the Jamaican government. 
The refinery produces about 750,000 metric tons of alumina a year. 

   Alcoa said primary aluminum production was being curtailed because of weakening demand for it, which has pushed aluminum-ingot prices down in the past several months.

   SPY BUSTERS stumble so far in efforts to crack the latest espionage case. 

   The FBI's failure to arrest suspected Soviet spy Felix Bloch, or get a confession, could soon permit him to seek a court order ending surveillance, defense lawyers say. 
No matter how the case comes out, the FBI faces questions about why the Soviets were able to warn Bloch of the inquiry, forcing it into the open. 
A nagging worry: Was there another breach of U.S. security? 

   The U.S. videotape of Bloch handing a briefcase to a KGB agent in Paris may not be enough evidence for a court case. 
"It's not illegal to transfer a briefcase, even to a KGB agent," says lawyer Frank Warren Bennett, "unless it contains national security documents." 
The U.S. still doesn't know what was inside. 

   But "if Bloch was a spy, the Soviets weren't paying him just for the routine stuff he was authorized to have," says former Pentagon aide Richard Perle. 

   POLITICAL TURMOIL in Japan jeopardizes chances to cut trade barriers. 

   The U.S., which has a huge trade deficit with Japan, wants to focus coming talks on practices it complains keep out Americans. 
These include bid-rigging, Japan's boycott of foreign goods, its distribution system and its government procurement policies. 
But political uncertainty may make it hard for Tokyo to push through any concessions. 

   The Japanese, for their part, want to discuss the U.S.'s low rate of savings and its budget deficit. 
Bush administration officials hope the talks, which start late next month, will produce proposals from both sides by year's end. 
But if the meetings bog down, Congress may press the administration to take more direct action against Japan. 

   BUSH DISAPPEARS on the abortion ruling, despite his anti-abortion stance. 

   The White House strategy is to avoid getting the president personally involved in the battle for state restrictions on abortion. 
Officials don't want to offend younger pro-choice Republicans, especially women. 
"I think his advisers are attempting to keep him away from a very divisive issue," says former Reagan aide Gary Bauer. 

   Bush's silence raises questions about how deep his convictions are against abortion. 
It is an issue that aides say he isn't comfortable with. 
His reticence on abortion contrasts sharply with his calls for a constitutional amendment against flag burning. 

   One aide seeks to put a positive spin on the silence by saying, straight-faced, Bush "feels so strongly" about abortion that he doesn't want to hurt the cause by seeming to interfere with the states. 

   DRUG BATTLE: Drug-czar Bennett clashes with Justice Department officials who "think they're running the show" in setting anti-drug priorities, says an administration official, who adds that Bennett believes he is in charge. 
Attorney General Thornburgh has said he is still the boss on drug-law enforcement. 

   DEBORAH DEAN'S FILES at HUD show favors she received and those her former boss, secretary Samuel Pierce, got. 
While ill, she received a teddy bear from developer Joseph Strauss, who reaped huge consulting fees on HUD projects. 
And contrary to federal regulations, HUD kept a car for Pierce's exclusive use in New York. 

   ADOPTION ADVOCATES plan to use the Supreme Court's decision limiting the right to abortion as leverage to seek new federal support for adoption. 
A tax deduction to help cover adoption expenses is a priority. 
GOP Rep. Smith of New Jersey sees political potential: "The Republicans need to be out in front on this." 

   PARTING SHOT? 
Customs Commissioner William von Raab, a Reagan-era holdover, may announce his departure as soon as Monday, and one colleague predicts, "He won't go quietly." 
The outspoken customs chief has tangled with Treasury bosses from Bush's team. 
Democratic Rep. Rangel urges Bush to keep von Raab because of his strong anti-drug stance. 

   PROSECUTORS CLOSE IN on top targets in the Pentagon fraud investigation. 

   The government is near to bringing cases against former Navy research chief Melvyn Paisley and consultant William Galvin. 
Both men, who have denied wrongdoing, are major figures in the year-long procurement probe. 
At least six major defense contractors also are under active scrutiny. 
Unisys Corp. may agree to pay nearly $100 million to resolve its part of the scandal. 

   The Justice Department shows no sign of reducing manpower for the investigation. 
Lead prosecutor Henry Hudson and even some defense lawyers predict nearly 100 convictions. 
There have been over 20 so far. 
In the wake of the charges, the Pentagon has tightened contracting procedures and sharply restricted the use of consultants. 

   The scandal may have scuttled hopes for any administration post for former Navy Secretary John Lehman, though he isn't under investigation. 

   MINOR MEMOS: The International Platform Association announces a major speaker for its Washington convention: former House Speaker Jim Wright. 
His topic: "The Human Side of Congress." . . .

   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposed fining a Transco Energy Co. unit $37 million for allegedly damaging archaeological sites in Alabama. 

   FERC charged that the Transco unit, Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corp., failed to get necessary clearances before constructing its Mobile Bay pipeline system in 1987. 
Natural-gas-transportation companies must submit information on an area's potential historic status before beginning construction. 

   A Transco spokeswoman said the company intends to fight the proposed penalty. 
She said Transco believes it had appropriate approvals, and has been assured it hasn't damaged any historic sites. 
Transco has 30 days to respond. 

   The commission said environmental consultants working for Transco surveyed the area for the pipeline and identified 77 archaeological sites. 
But, FERC charged, Transco began construction before determining whether the sites were eligible for special status, as required. 
It also alleged that Transco failed to get proper authorization from Alabama's historic preservation officer to build and operate the facilities. 

   FERC alleges Transco damaged or destroyed at least 22 historic sites that are "at least in part within the right-of-way of the Mobile Bay pipeline." 
It proposed "at this juncture" a $37 million civil penalty, though it said the maximum penalty allowed is $93 million. 
A commission spokeswoman said a final determination will be made after the company answers the charges. 

   Alabama Historic Commission representatives couldn't be reached for comment.

   House and Senate negotiators on the sweeping savings-and-loan bill set the stage for a test of wills with President Bush by rejecting his plan for financing the package, then approving the 1,000-page bill. 

   How to raise $166 billion for closing sick savings-and-loan companies was the last major issue to be decided by the conferees on the landmark bill, which replenishes funds in the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., overhauls banking and thrift industry regulations, and requires S&amp;Ls to risk more of their own capital before FSLIC insurance bails out depositors at an insolvent institution. 

   The compromise bill heads back to both chambers for final consideration next week, and could be on the president's desk by next Friday. 

   After months of the stalemate and almost six hours of debate of the financing plan yesterday, the Senate conferees persuaded Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), the lone Democratic holdout, to adopt the House financing plan, largely in exchange for acceding to him in an earlier agreement to keep the nation's top thrift official in place. 

   "I reluctantly support this motion," Sen. Cranston said. 
"Otherwise I see everlasting impasse in this conference." 

   Bush administration officials have vowed that such a move would prompt a veto recommendation, and yesterday Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Budget Director Richard Darman reiterated the message. 
"We are pleased that the conference committee has finished work on the savings-and-loan legislation, which is generally an excellent product," Mr. Brady said. 
"However, the administration position on financing is perfectly clear and remains unchanged." 

   But President Bush may be hard pressed to summon a veto on a bill he unveiled in February as "emergency" legislation, and one in which the administration's plan prevailed in almost every other important issue. 
"The bill has so much that the president wants, and it's so important for the country, it's hard to believe that he would veto it" because of the funding issue, said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), one of the proponents of the House financing plan. 

   The primary purpose of the bill is to raise $50 billion that would be used to close or merge hundreds of insolvent savings-and-loan companies. 
But how that money will be raised became a game of chicken between the administration and Democrats, who otherwise have largely backed the administration's tough positions. 

   The administration plan would raise $50 billion using industry bonds, which wouldn't be included on the federal budget, and thus not increase the budget deficit. 
The interest of more than $100 billion, to be paid mostly by the taxpayer, would be on the budget. 
But using industry bonds would increase the cost by more than $5 billion over 30 years, because they would carry a higher interest rate than Treasury bonds. 

   The House approved a plan to raise the money using Treasury bonds, and including the spending on the budget. 
The ultimate costs are lower, but it would require a waiver of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, a precedent the administration viewed as the first step in eroding discipline in the budget. 

   In a peculiar exchange, the fate of the financing plan hinged upon the close relationship between Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah) and his former aide, Danny Wall, now chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
House conferees, who had been intent on forcing Mr. Wall to again face confirmation by the Senate to keep his job, dropped their opposition in exchange for the on-budget vote. 

   "I'm not the kind who makes deals," said House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), "but {several senators} said they could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn's insistence on Wall." 
On Wednesday, Mr. Gonzalez paved the way for speedy approval of steps to protect Mr. Wall's job. 

   Sen. Cranston, who voted for the administration plan in the Senate, also had reason to preserve Mr. Wall's job without reconfirmation hearings. 
His confrontations with Mr. Wall over a now-insolvent California thrift would have undoubtedly come under scrutiny again in a hearing. 

   Sen. Cranston proposed several compromises that would have put some of the money off-budget, but still violate the administration's proposal by requiring a Gramm-Rudman exemption. 
In the end, he conceded. 
"Deadlock is intolerable," he said. 
"Delay is intolerable." 

   Late last night, the conferees were finishing up provisions in the bill, including an attempt to strip the bill of special exemptions for certain institutions. 

   Late last night, the conferees completed final provisions in the bill, including one to establish conflict-of-interest rules for employees of the Resolution Trust Corp., the huge new arm of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will oversee thrift closures and sales of their assets. 

   The bill, which conferees hope the president will sign before the August recess, could still face hurdles, however. 
The Senate could invoke a rule to require 60 votes for its passage, due to the Gramm-Rudman exemption. 
Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) has said earlier that he would call for the rule. 

   Key provisions of the bill include: 

   --Minimum capital, or the cash cushion for thrifts, would be 1.5% of assets. 
The greater the risk to a thrift's assets, the greater must be its capital base. 

   --The Federal Home Loan Bank Board would become an arm of the Treasury. 
Bank regulators and the Treasury would oversee the Resolution Trust Corp., which will sell or merge insolvent thrifts and their assets using $50 billion during the next three years. 

   --Deposit insurance premiums would be raised for banks and thrifts. 

   --Bank-holding companies would be permitted to acquire healthy thrifts immediately, which was prohibited under current law. 

   --Investments in high-yield junk bonds and other risky activities would be prohibited or allowed only in separately capitalized affiliates. 

   --Thrifts would be required to invest more in home mortgages. 

   --Federal Home Loan Banks would be required to contribute a percentage of their earnings toward low-income homebuyers.

@  Cost-Cutting Plan,
@  Boosts Rebates

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has launched an aggressive $1 billion cost-cutting program that includes plans for an 8% reduction in its white-collar ranks by the end of this year. 

   The program takes effect immediately and will run through the end of 1990. 
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca unveiled the measures to the auto maker's top managers at a meeting here yesterday. 

   The moves come as the U.S. auto industry struggles to cope with a slowing economy and growing overcapacity -- the ability to build more vehicles than consumers want to buy. 
To help deal with this in the short-term, Chrysler yesterday doubled rebates on six of its slowest-selling cars. 
The midsized Eagle Premier, for example, now carries a $2,000 cash incentive instead of $1,000, and Omni and Horizon subcompacts now have a $1,500 rebate that amounts to nearly 25% off the base price. 

   At a news conference, Bennett E. Bidwell, chairman of the Chrysler Motors unit, predicted that total U.S. car and truck sales in 1990 will fall to about 14.2 million vehicles from an estimated 14.7 million this year and almost 16 million in 1988. 
Chrysler, with many aging models, is bearing a disproportionate share of the decline. 

   But Mr. Iacocca emphasized in a prepared statement that the company's new program "will not be a one-shot deal" stemming solely from the industry's sales slump. 
"The car and truck business in the U.S. is undergoing a dramatic and permanent transformation that puts enormous pressures on all manufacturers to get their programs and costs in line," he said. 
"We must take the necessary steps to ensure our profitability." 

   These steps include reducing salaried employment by about 2,300, or 8%, from Chrysler's total of roughly 30,000 white-collar workers by year-end. 
Chrysler said it hopes to accomplish most of the cuts through early retirement or buy-outs. 

   This cut, along with cuts in other personnel costs, including fringe benefits and overtime pay, would account for some $240 million of the $1 billion target, Mr. Bidwell said. 
He added that the manpower reductions "will adversely impact" Chrysler's fourth-quarter earnings, but "if we do it right, the actions we're taking should go to the bottom line beginning in the first quarter of 1990." 
He didn't elaborate. 

   Chrysler announced its program after the market closed yesterday. 
Chrysler stock fell $1.25 to $24.875 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. 

   The cost-cutting program won't affect the No. 3 auto maker's long-range product plans, warranty programs or customer satisfaction efforts. 
But it will include trimming purchased material costs, eliminating "internal inefficiencies" and "redundancies" and improving controls on product design and manufacturing costs in Chrysler's vehicle-making and selling operations, the company said. 
Chrysler technical and financial-services subsidiaries will have their own cost-reduction programs beyond the $1 billion target for Chrysler Motors. 

   To encourage managers to meet the cost-cutting goals, Chrysler is adopting an unusual incentive that allows the managers to "bet" on Chrysler's performance by automatically transferring 5% or 10% of their salary to a special escrow account. 
Participants lose all their wager if Chrysler cuts less than $500 million during the course of the program. 
If the cuts exceed that amount, participants would get payoffs ranging on a graduated scale from half their investment to double their investment if the $1 billion goal is met. 
Participants get an additional payoff if Chrysler's stock price rises above $24.50 a share -- an average of recent prices -- by the end of the 1990, when the program and incentive are scheduled to end. 

   Chrysler will offer the voluntary program to some 2,000 of its managers; all 29 of the top officers, including Mr. Bidwell and Mr. Iacocca, signed on at the 10% level, Mr. Bidwell said. 

   Chrysler's new sales incentives are intended to ease overcrowding on the lots of dealers, who had an average 83-day supply of Omni and Horizon subcompacts and an 85-day supply of Premiers as of July 10. 
A 60-day supply is considered normal. 

   Other models that get doubled rebates include the Sundance and Shadow compacts, with new incentives of $1,500, and the Eagle Summit, with $1,000. 
Chrysler also added a new $300 rebate on certain Colt three-door hatchbacks, and raised to $750 from $500 the rebate on some Colts with automatic transmissions.

   Empire of America Federal Savings Bank posted a $54.2 million net loss in the second quarter and warned that its shareholder equity for common stockholders would be wiped out by Sept. 30 if such losses persist. 

   The nation's 17th-largest savings institution cited a marked decline in net interest income and a sharp increase in its provision for possible loan losses for the second-quarter loss, which included a $5.2 million reversal of a tax credit recognized in a prior quarter. 
In the year-ago quarter, Empire posted a loss of $19.8 million. 

   In the latest quarter, net interest income fell to $21.6 million, about half the $43.4 million of the year-earlier period. 
The loan-loss provision increased to $40.1 million from $24.4 million a year ago and largely reflected growth in recent years of the bank's consumer-loan portfolio, particularly its VISA credit card and automobile-lending operations. 
Empire recently completed the sale of $650 million, or about 90%, of its VISA portfolio. 

   The second-period loss -- which followed a $3.1 million first-quarter profit and last year's $57.3 million net loss -- reduced Empire's total shareholders' equity to $104.6 million. 
Kent Dixon, president and chief executive officer, said if Empire has another loss the size of the second-quarter deficit, the only shareholders' equity remaining at the end of the third quarter would be attributable to its preferred stock held by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. 

   In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Empire's stock closed at $1, down 12.5 cents.

   The dollar was mixed after a report on second-quarter U.S. economic growth assuaged some recession concerns. 

   Traders said the U.S. currency was also aided by technical factors when the dollar encountered buying interest at levels the market considered important. 

   The preliminary estimate of the second-quarter gross national product showed moderate economic growth of 1.7%, in line with market expectations and a substantial slowdown from a revised 3.7% growth rate in the first quarter. 

   While the decelerating economic activity reflected in the report continues to justify interest-rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and underscores the possibility of a recession, many traders said statistics on U.S. business-inventory levels dispelled worries of a sharp build-up entailing deep production cutbacks. 

   "It looks like we're heading for the soft landing," said Garrett Glass, vice president of foreign exchange at First National Bank of Chicago. 
With manufacturers relieved of additional pressure to reduce output, "that could help GNP {growth} to stay around 2% this quarter," he said. 

   Also stimulating the dollar's rebound is the perception that the Fed, after letting the federal-funds rate drop a quarter point to a middling range of around 9% Wednesday, will stand pat on credit for the next several weeks. 
Federal funds are overnight loans of reserves among Fed member banks. 

   In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8782 marks, up from 1.8675 marks Wednesday, and at 139.26 yen, down from 140.02 yen. 
The pound was at $1.6554, down from $1.6590. 

   In trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar opened at 139.30 yen, down from 139.35 yen at the close there Thursday. 

   Strong demand returned for the yen Thursday after its sharp fall on recent Japanese political concerns, boosting it against all major currencies. 
The mark, which registered some of the strongest gains against the yen at the height of the concerns, slumped to 74.145 yen late Thursday in New York, well below 74.98 yen Wednesday. 

   Traders said the yen was helped by the modest reverberations from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's defeat Sunday in a national election for half the seats in parliament's upper house. 
The LDP has moved swiftly to find a safe replacement for embattled Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and to reform its image. 

   Unless the LDP's struggle to jettison its scandal-ridden past appears to be failing, the yen should make further gains during the next few weeks as the market buys back short-yen positions and again focuses on investment opportunities in the strong Japanese economy, said Dan Brooks, chief foreign-exchange dealer at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York. 

   While the yen made steady gains in Asian trading, the dollar held fast against other currencies. 
When Europe took over the arena, activity diminished as participants awaited the U.S. GNP report. 

   The dollar initially sank on the report's release as some participants sought to ignite a move on the low GNP growth, but the drive quickly lost momentum after running into a wave of dollar buyers around 1.8625 marks, which dealers termed an important level on charts. 

   The inability to overcome buying interest and the positive aspects of the GNP report triggered short-covering by players who had sold the dollar during its recent slide and lifted the U.S. currency through the New York afternoon. 

   The GNP report showed inventories grew at a $22 billion annual pace, down from a $24.5 billion rate in the first quarter. 
Two important inflation measures released with the GNP, the implicit price deflator and the fixed-weight deflator, both reflected inflation levels in the quarter close to predictions, at 4.9% and 5.2% rates, respectively. 

   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $373.70 an ounce, down $1.20. 
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces. 

   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $372.85 an ounce.

<HL> Bill to Bar Burning
@  Of Flag as Protest
@  Clears House Unit

   The House Judiciary Committee approved legislation designed to circumvent a Supreme Court ruling that prohibits states from punishing a person who burns the U.S. flag as a political protest. 

   The 28-6 vote by which the proposed criminal statute was passed belies the partisan division created by the issue in the House. 
It came after a sometimes raucous committee meeting in which Chairman Jack Brooks (D., Texas) blocked Republican efforts to substitute a constitutional amendment and committee Democrats defeated other GOP attempts to derail the measure. 

   The full House is to consider the bill in mid-September, shortly after lawmakers return from a monthlong recess. 
In the Senate, Democratic and GOP leaders have agreed to consider both a statute and a constitutional amendment in October. 

   The Judiciary Committee's measure would make it a crime for anyone to "knowingly mutilate, deface, burn or trample upon" a flag, punishable by as long as one year in prison and an unspecified fine. 
An exception would be made for disposing of a worn or soiled flag. 

   Currently, federal law makes it a crime to "knowingly cast contempt" upon a flag by "publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling upon it" and provides penalties of as long as a year in prison and a fine of as much as $1,000. 

   Last month, the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration. 
The court said he was "engaging in political expression" that is protected by the First Amendment. 
By dropping the phrase "cast contempt," proponents of the legislation believe it would avoid the court's objection by targeting an action rather the intent behind it. 

   The committee-passed bill includes a provision calling for expedited judicial review of the statute, and Rep. Brooks vowed to introduce a constitutional amendment himself should it fall. 

   House Republicans, along with President Bush, say only a constitutional amendment would protect the flag. 
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu this week urged House GOP leaders to continue pressing the flag issue because he believes it could divide House Democrats, according to House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.). 

   The Democratic leadership is more wary of tampering with the Bill of Rights and wants first to try a statutory remedy. 
But Democrats also are angry and nervous over the way Mr. Bush used the flag to associate himself with patriotic values in last year's presidential campaign and are fearful of being driven in the same corner that Michael Dukakis found himself regarding the Pledge of Allegiance issue. 

   House Democrats, including Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington and Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, jammed a small stage to face television cameras and praise the bill. 
They also used the opportunity to fire a salvo in the battle of symbols. 

   While Mr. Bush used the Iwo Jima Memorial as a backdrop when he called for a constitutional amendment, the lawmakers came armed with the flag that flew over the Capitol the day Pearl Harbor was bombed, in Rome after that city was liberated in World War II, and over the USS Missouri when Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's surrender.

   Raychem Corp., citing an unprofitable subsidiary and slimmer profit margins, said net income fell 75% in the fourth quarter ended June 30 on a 4.5% drop in revenue. 

   The electronics concern said profit fell to $12.97 million, or 37 cents a share, from $52.80 million, or $1.52 a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue fell to $300.81 million from $314.87 million. 
Fiscal 1989 net fell 71% to $36.35 million on a 1.1% drop in revenue to $1.08 billion. 

   The company attributed its lackluster bottom line to its Raynet subsidiary, which had a $15 million loss in the quarter and $55.07 million in the year. 
Raynet, a relatively new unit that designs fiber-optics systems, had a loss because it is still developing products and markets, a spokesman said. 
Raychem is seeking outside investment in the unit. 

   Raychem also blamed slimmer profit margins caused by a shift in its sales away from military buyers to civilian aircraft and automobile customers, where profits are thinner. 
The shift has caused factory overcapacity in some products, it said. 

   Raychem's marginal effective tax rate -- 26% in fiscal 1988 -- climbed to 43% in the third quarter of 1989, which affected net income, the company said. 
And a strengthening dollar cut profit on overseas sales, which make up about 60% of the company's revenue, it said. 

   Raychem, which makes wires, cables and connectors for a broad range of industries, said it expects revenue to grow 5% to 10% in fiscal 1990. 
Development outlays at Raynet will reduce fiscal 1990 pre-tax profit about $60 million, it said. 

   Raychem's shares closed yesterday at $35.25, down 25 cents on New York Stock Exchange trading.

   The chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees financial markets raised the possibility of clamping down on stock-index futures activity if studies show traders are manipulating the indexes for their own benefit. 

   Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.) made his comments in response to a Securities and Exchange Commission staff study that found a link between index arbitrage -- taking advantage of small differences between stock prices and futures prices -- and price volatility in the stock markets. 
Mr. Markey has expressed concern that volatility is frightening small investors away from the markets. 

   "Getting to the bottom of what creates the spread between the futures and the stock market should be a top priority for our market regulators," Mr. Markey said. 
"If we find that the spreads are caused by inefficient market mechanics or manipulative trading practices, we will have to reassess the relationship between futures trading and the stock market." 

   Limits on stock-index futures aren't likely soon. 
But the SEC economics division said it was studying whether price differences are caused by "news or noise," that is, whether the markets are responding to legitimate economic data or not. 

   Mr. Markey released the SEC staff report at a hearing at which some former brokers and exchange officials said they believe some manipulative practices -- such as "front-running," in which brokers use knowledge of coming customer orders in trading for their own account -- are common. 
The SEC staff said it doesn't believe front-running is "widespread." 
Subcommittee staff members said they planned to pursue the issue in hearings this fall with regulators and exchange officials.

   A unit of Neoax Inc. agreed to pay the government about $2.3 million to settle claims that the company submitted false information in connection with contracts to build radar equipment for F-15 fighter aircraft, the Justice Department said. 

   The manufacturing company previously paid the government about $1 million in connection with the same alleged contract fraud, the department said. 

   A spokesman for Neoax, based in Stamford, Conn., said, "The settlement will have no impact on Neoax's results of operations or financial condition." 

   Neoax earlier voluntarily disclosed to the government that its Nuclear Automation Inc. unit had committed contract fraud between 1982 and 1986. 

   The Justice Department said that Neoax's total payment of $3.3 million would resolve the company's potential liability for monetary damages and civil penalties. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Neoax shares closed at $11.75, unchanged.

   SOVIET LAWMAKERS ADOPTED economic resolutions for the Baltics. 

   The Supreme Soviet overwhelmingly approved two resolutions paving the way for Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to have greater control of their economies. 
One measure would allow the three Baltic states to trade independently with the 12 other Soviet republics. 
The other supports a draft law calling for economic independence by Jan. 1 for Estonia and Lithuania, which have declared themselves sovereign states. 

   The parliament's action was considered a major victory for Baltic activists, who have accused Moscow of sapping the republics' natural resources.

   Bethlehem Steel Corp. said it will spend $300 million to build three new sheet-coating lines, increasing its sheet-coating capabilities by about 765,000 tons a year. 

   The nation's second-largest steelmaker, after USX Corp., has a current coating capacity of more than one million tons, and said it will build a 72-inch galvanizing line at its Burns Harbor plant in Indiana designed primarily to serve the automotive market. 
The project, scheduled for completion in 1992, will produce 450,000 tons of steel that can better accommodate paint and adhesive products. 

   Bethlehem said it believes the automotive industry, while currently in a slump, will need "substantial additional tonnage" of so called hot-dip galvanized product by 1995 as car makers increasingly shift from cold-rolled sheet steel, which doesn't have the same corrosion protection as hot-dip products. 

   A 48-inch line to make galvanized sheets for the non-automotive market will be built by 1992 at Bethlehem's Sparrows Point, Md., plant and replace some existing hot-dip capacity at that plant. 
A third line, essentially a duplicate of the 48-inch Sparrows Point facility, will be built on an undisclosed site in the South or Southwest to serve the construction market. 
Bethlehem said it expects the third line to be a joint venture with at least one other company. 

   Bethlehem said the two lines will allow it to take advantage of expected growth in the light construction market. 
The company expects to fund the capital improvements with debt financing.

   He used to dress up as Moses, let his "followers" come on stage to touch him, and expect them to do exactly as he said. 

   This was no religious cult leader. 
This was Joe Granville, stock market technician, news letter writer and showman extraordinaire. 

   For a decade in the 1970s and early 1980s, his words moved in vestors to terror or elation. 
In January 1981, for instance, he said to "sell everything," and a lot of investors did just that. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 24 points -- a huge loss at the time -- on record volume. 

   Today, Joseph Granville's words mainly evoke snickers, in part because of his stubborn refusal to recognize the great bull market that started in August 1982. 
It took him some four years to reverse his position, and by that time, his huge following was gone. 

   But Mr. Granville's recommendations since the stock market crash have been right on target, and at age 65 he's trying to make a comeback. 
"I want to spend the bulk of my remaining years teaching people how to use {the market indicators Mr. Granville has developed} so when I'm gone they will know how to do it themselves," he says. 

   The man who quietly publishes his Granville Market Letter in Kansas City, Mo., seems far removed from the Joe Granville of a decade ago. 

   At the height of his influence, Mr. Granville was a glitzy showman. 
Chimpanzees romped on stage with him; laser lights blazed to entertain the crowds at his investment seminars. 

   The man was "out of control," says New York money manager Jack Orben. 
He "turned the profession into a burlesque," charges New Jersey money manager Kenneth Hackel. 

   Mr. Granville's response: "I observed that when people are entertained they will retain more knowledge." 

   Whatever the case, his followers loved him. 
Even people who say Mr. Granville's advice cost them money still talk about him affectionately. 

   John B. Olinger, a retired postal worker in Florida, used to subscribe to Mr. Granville's letter (now $250 a year) and paid extra for Mr. Granville's telephone early-warning service. 
He says he felt he'd "finally hit on a secret formula to beat the stock market." 

   Dutifully following Mr. Granville's advice, Mr. Olinger says, he sold all of his stocks in 1981. 
In addition, he bought put options and sold stocks short, two tactics designed to make money when stock prices decline. 

   "I lost over $100,000," Mr. Olinger says. 
"It's taken me 10 years to gain back what I lost in just a few months by going with Joe Granville." 

   So what does Mr. Olinger think about Joe Granville now? 
"You can't help but like the guy," he says. 
"He's a good talker. 
His theory is real sound, and it makes a lot of sense. 
Basically, it's a good theory. 
The only trouble is, it doesn't work." 

   Mr. Granville's method is a technical system that emphasizes trading volume when stock prices are rising compared with volume when stock prices are declining. 
He also uses a wide variety of other gauges, many of which he devised or refined. 

   Mark Hulbert, whose Hulbert Financial Digest estimates the performance investors would get by following newsletters' advice, figures that people who acted on Mr. Granville's recommendations lost 98% of their money from mid-1980 through the end of 1987. 

   A week after the 1987 crash, however, Mr. Granville began what he hopes will be his comeback. 
On Oct. 26, while almost everyone else was still scurrying for cover, Mr. Granville boldly proclaimed that people should buy stocks and hold them. 
Ever since, defying occasional market dips, Mr. Granville has steadily reiterated his advice to buy. 
So far, he has been right. 

   Mr. Hulbert now ranks the Granville Market Letter first among some 110 investment newsletters for the first half of 1989. 
Investors who followed Mr. Granville's advice would have gained an estimated 156%, he figures. 

   As Mr. Granville rightly says, "No one else is even close." 

   "My Oct. 26, 1987, call will probably be the best market call I ever made in my life, but to me it was the easiest call," Mr. Granville says. 
"We had the most classical selling climax. 
The public were scared out of their wits." 

   Before long, Mr. Granville was looking at his charts and discerning an "ascending triangle" formation. 
To him, it signaled that the market's recovery wouldn't stop until the Dow Jones Industrial Average hits 2840. 
That's about 200 points above current levels. 
He expects it to happen by Labor Day. 

   He then expects a drop of 100 to 200 points. 
"But further out I see tremendous things in 1990," he says. 

   Recently, he has been advising subscribers to lighten their holdings by using "stop" orders, in which investors tell their brokers to sell if a stock drops below a specified threshold. 
Mr. Granville says investors with gains should progressively raise their stops, but allow themselves to be "stopped out" when the market dips. 
That way, he says, investors will have cash on hand to do some heavy buying around the end of the year. 
In attempting his comeback, Mr. Granville has some strong boosters. 
One is Michael Bronzino, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. commodity representative who tries to apply versions of Mr. Granville's techniques to commodity trading. 
"He knows market history like no one I've spoken to before, and he knows human psychology," Mr. Bronzino says. 

   When he tells other people that he consults with Joe Granville, "They think I'm out of my mind," Mr. Bronzino says. 

   Mr. Granville still calls his subscribers "followers," but he won't say how many there are. 
And he says his theatrics are behind him. 
"That's completely out of my system." 

   As much as he enjoys his new hot streak, Mr. Granville knows he has a long way to go to recapture his former prominence. 
When major brokerage houses such as E.F. Hutton, Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch used to sponsor his seminars, he demanded guaranteed crowds of at least 1,500 people. 
In June 1981, he packed New York's Carnegie Hall for a presentation in which he gave market guidance and played the piano. 

   Last month, he came to New York for another seminar. 
Only 14 people showed up, by Mr. Bronzino's count. 
Mr. Granville doesn't quarrel with the number, but he says the seminar was "the most successful one I've given." 

   "I don't measure success in terms of numbers. 
I look at it as Chopin would, giving a teaching lesson to his pupils. 
In time, if I keep calling the market the way I've been calling it, obviously the world will beat a path back to my door."

   The state of New Hampshire endorsed a revised offer by Northeast Utilities to acquire troubled Public Service Co. of New Hampshire for about $1.9 billion, but creditors of PS of New Hampshire said they consider the new proposal too low. 

   Northeast's latest offer is the first of several reorganization plans expected to be proposed shortly in PS of New Hampshire's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. 

   While Northeast could benefit from the state's support, any plan -- whether a purchase of the company or an internal reorganization -- must be approved by the court and creditors. 
As a result, the state's backing doesn't guarantee success for Northeast's bid. 

   Indeed, some creditors say they will oppose Northeast's proposal. 
"This is not an adequate bid from our perspective," said Daniel Frank, a fund manager at Fidelity Investments, a giant mutual-fund company that is the largest holder of PS of New Hampshire unsecured debt and stock. 
"We think the value of the company is well in excess of $2 billion." 

   An internal reorganization plan supported by PS of New Hampshire officials is expected to be submitted soon. 
In addition, New England Electric Service, which made an earlier proposal, said it will make a revised offer within the next month that will top Northeast's latest proposal.

   The pace of new car sales in Europe quickened in June against year-earlier levels, but even as the industry's boom hums along into its fourth year some observers see dark clouds down the road. 

   While sales growth remained solid in southern Europe's biggest markets, gains were more modest in West Germany and Britain and sales actually declined throughout Scandinavia. 
Analysts note that the gains in some places were probably the product of incentive programs. 

   "The quality of sales is deteriorating," says Stephen Reitman, an industry analyst for Phillips &amp; Drew Ltd. 
In West Germany and Britain in particular, auto makers are "fighting very hard for market share." 

   Industry and government statistics from 12 countries, which normally account for about 94% of non-communist Europe's passenger car sales, indicated volume rose 6.8% in June from a year ago to 1,134,238 units. 
The June figure also rose 0.6% fromMay. 

   The rise in the latest month appears to confirm analysts' and industry projections that the upturn in auto sales is continuing. 
It follows a slight 1.2% year-on-year decline in May but otherwise fits the 6.5% average growth rate for the year so far.

   In this Islamic republic, getting out the vote isn't a problem -- even when the winner of the election isn't in doubt. 

   Voting here is a religious obligation as well as a civil one. 
And with everybody over the age of 15 eligible to cast a ballot and voter turnout traditionally about 70%, election authorities are bracing for an estimated 17 million of Iran's 50 million population to take part in the presidential poll and constitutional referendum today. 

   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini used to make a point of voting first thing on election day. 
Pictures of the imam casting his ballot are almost as plentiful in the streets of Tehran as banners of parliamentary leader Hashemi Rafsanjani, the principal presidential candidate. 

   Pictures of his opponent, Abbas Sheibani, aren't nearly so evident. 
The parliamentarian and former agriculture minister is the only one of 78 would-be challengers to Mr. Rafsanjani not to be disqualified. 
The others all were deemed unfit because they lacked sufficient political credentials or personal religious piety. 

   Dr. Sheibani's political platform is almost indistinguishable from Mr. Rafsanjani's. 
Both men, according to official biographies, stress their numerous terms of imprisonment under the shah -- Dr. Sheibani boasting 13 years in jail while Mr. Rafsanjani has to make do with five arrests that led to sentences ranging from 40 days to three years. 
Both say they'll hold to a nonaligned foreign policy, and both stress economic reform and reconstruction as a priority. 

   "There isn't any Western-style competition between us," Dr. Sheibani said in an interview with an Iranian newspaper. 
One of his main reasons for running, he said, is that the Iranian parliament "isn't ready to lose such a good speaker" as Mr. Rafsanjani. 

   Dr. Sheibani says he told would-be backers not to waste their money on campaigning for him but to donate their contributions instead to purchasing stationery for needy schoolchildren. 
Mr. Rafsanjani apparently didn't give his backers similar advice, or if he did, they haven't heeded it. 
Bazaaris, or merchants, have bought expensive front-page advertisements in the press urging a vote for Mr. Rafsanjani. 
The less well-heeled students association issued a statement in his support. 
And a group called "Hezbollah Youth from Qom" has brought out a poster showing the speaker in a diverse range of moods -- looking pensive and intellectual, and as a man of action, without clerical turban, heading off to the battlefield in military fatigues. 

   But perhaps the real clincher for Mr. Rafsanjani is the endorsement he has received from the Khomeini family. 
Both the late ayatollah's son Ahmad and a daughter, Zahra Mostafavi, have urged his election, praising both his management abilities and his loyalty to their father. 

   Voters also are expected to endorse a referendum for constitutional reform that will consolidate the power of the presidency, making it possible for Mr. Rafsanjani to institute reforms virtualy unhindered. 
However, the referendum stops short of abolishing the power of the leader of the Islamic republic to dismiss the president, so Mr. Rafsanjani will remain in office at the will of the Ayatollah Ali Khameini.

   The new partnership between American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Italtel S.p.A., although rich with the potential of combined strength, must be ready to fight to win a major slice of the European private telecommunications market, industry analysts say. 

   Under terms of an operating agreement worked out between AT&amp;T and Italtel, the two partners have agreed to set up a joint-venture company for the distribution of private telecommunications equipment in Europe. 

   The new company will focus initially on four markets -- Britain, Greece, Portugal and Spain, according to a confidential document obtained by Dow Jones International News Service. 

   An Italtel spokeswoman in Milan declined to comment, and AT&amp;T officials in Rome couldn't be reached for comment. 

   According to the document, AT&amp;T will own a majority stake, while Italtel Telematica SPA, Italtel's manufacturer of private telecommunications products, will own the rest of the joint venture, which doesn't have a name yet. 

   The accord is the first concrete step resulting from a wide-ranging collaboration accord signed in June between the U.S. telecommunications giant and the Italian state-owned telecommunications equipment maker. 
Italtel is a unit of Stet S.p.A., the state holding company for the telecommunications industry. 
AT&amp;T acquired a 20% stake in Italtel as part of the June accord. 

   "This is a very interesting deal, but you don't just walk into the European telecommunications market and find that everyone bows down to welcome you," says Richard Cunningham, telecommunications analyst with Citicorp Scrimgeour-Vickers in London. 

   "AT&amp;T already tried once before with the Phillips (Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V.) joint venture, which failed. 
It remains to be seen how they fare this time around," Mr. Cunningham said. 
According to industry sources, the two companies are planning to acquire a series of small European companies that could distribute products already manufactured separately by AT&amp;T and Italtel. 

   "There are a lot of companies who are going to be very anxious to send them {AT&amp;T and Italtel} back home packing," says Mr. Cunningham of Citicorp Scrimgeour-Vickers. 

   Analysts agree that the toughest market targeted by AT&amp;T and Italtel is in the U.K., where intense competition between Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson and a joint venture formed by Britain's General Electric Co. PLC, which isn't related to the U.S. company, and Plessey Co. PLC, means only the most advanced products will be able to find a niche. 

   In Spain, one of Europe's fastest-growing telecommunications markets, AT&amp;T has already managed to cull some phone-exchange contracts. 
However, the AT&amp;T-Italtel venture will have to move quickly to build up its market share and "may have already missed the boat," one analyst said. 

   The less advanced Greek and Portuguese markets have farther to go and lack a major supplier of telephone exchanges, but they are also largely dependent on European Community funding for such investments. 

   As for public telecommunications equipment, Italtel's Linea UT switching system and AT&amp;T's ESS5 switch will be the core products to be marketed initially by a 50-50 joint venture that will be formed between Netherlands-based AT&amp;T Network Systems International and Italtel. 

   In Italy, Italtel will continue to distribute the Linea UT switch, which will be beefed up with such AT&amp;T technology as toll-free dialing services and advanced transmission systems. 

   In addition, the possibility of introducing the Linea UT to the U.S. market will be studied, according to the agreement. 

   However, analysts described the two latter provisions as more "diplomatic" measures designed to reinforce Italtel's autonomy in the young partnership. 

   Products assembled from parts made by both companies may be available as soon as next year, but industry experts aren't expecting a jointly developed product to hit the market until at least 1991. 

   "What's going to be most interesting isn't the here-and-now, but what happens further down the road," says Dorian Foyil, telecommunications analyst for UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew in London. 

   Adds Mr. Foyil: "They need to get used to each other and hone their products. 
It remains to be seen whether or not the cooperation between AT&amp;T and Italtel really bears fruit." 

   In the long term, analysts agree, the test for the new partnership will be whether it can develop and maintain the kind of state-of-the-art technology the market demands, and, simultaneously, move into the more advanced French and West German markets, where there already are major suppliers.

   Falling interest rates sent investors to the stock market in droves, and share prices finished generally higher in heavy trading. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit another post-crash high, rising 22.38 to 2635.43. 
That left the average needing to rise just 87 points, or 3.3%, to pass its record close of 2722.42 set in August 1987. 

   Yesterday's rally came after a government report said gross national product growth in the second quarter slowed to a 1.7% annual rate from a revised 3.7% in the first three months of the year. 
Investors figure that slower growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to continue to lower interest rates gradually and keep the economy from falling into a recession. 

   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange swelled to 213,680,000 shares, the highest since June 16, when 244,510,000 shares were traded in the latest quarterly "triple witching hour" session of futures and options expirations. 

   Broader averages that reached all-time highs Wednesday made still more impressive gains yesterday. 
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 3.94 to 341.99 -- equivalent to a 30-point rise in the industrial average -- and the New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 2.08 to 190.22. 
The Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 3.63 to 320.60. 

   Traders said second-quarter earnings reports, merger news, asset allocation and stock-index arbitrage all played a role in yesterday's gains and volume. 

   In the merger arena, Squibb soared 24 3/4 to 112 1/2 in Big Board trading of 3.4 million shares, and Bristol-Myers, the most active Big Board issue, dropped 2 3/8 to 49 1/2 on 4.5 million shares. 
A merger agreement between the two calls for Bristol-Myers to exchange 2.4 common shares for each of Squibb's 97 million shares outstanding. 
At yesterday's closing prices, Squibb holders would receive more than $118 of stock for each share held. 

   Other drug stocks that rallied on the news and were actively traded included Upjohn, which went up 1 5/8 to 33; Pfizer, up 2 1/2 to 63 3/4; Eli Lilly, up 7/8 to 63 1/2, and Syntex, up 1 3/4 to 50. 

   The product of an earlier industry merger, SmithKline Beecham, advanced 3/4 to 42 3/8 on 3.6 million shares. 
Marion Laboratories, which has agreed to combine its operations with those of Dow Chemical's drug unit, rose 1/8 to 35 7/8. 

   Stock-index arbitrage buy programs, in which traders sell index futures and buy the underlying stocks to profit from small, temporary price differences, kicked off the heavy trading in the morning. 

   This was followed by a large amount of buying by asset allocators who juggle their investments among stocks, bonds and cash. 
Falling interest rates generally prompt a switch out of cash and bonds into stocks. 

   Kenneth Spence, technical analyst at Salomon Brothers, said money flows showed the huge amount of cash pouring into stocks yesterday. 
He said $784 million flowed into the New York Stock Exchange, of which $634 million was in block trades. 
That's bigger than most other recent flows and is regarded as a sign of a heavy cash commitment by large institutional accounts. 

   Mark Donahoe, block trader for Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, said a number of technically oriented traders also jumped into the market. 
He said stocks such as Anheuser Busch, United Telecom and Symbol Technologies appear to be breaking out of recent trading ranges on strong volume. 

   Among stocks in the Dow Jones industrials, Merck rose 2 1/4 to 77 7/8, and Eastman Kodak, parent of Sterling Drug, rose 1 1/2 to 48 3/4. 
Other standout gainers included American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which set a 52-week high, rallying 1 1/4 to 40 5/8 on 3.8 million shares; USX, which rose 1 1/2 to 36 5/8; and Primerica, which advanced 1 3/8 to 27 1/4. 

   Security Pacific rose 1 1/8 to 51 1/2 on 4.2 million shares. 
Activity related to the company's forthcoming quarterly dividend swelled volume in the stock; also, the company moved to forge closer ties with Japan's Mitsui Bank by signing a letter of intent to acquire a 20% stake in Mitsui's California subsidiary. 

   Rumors that someone would soon disclose ownership of more than a 5% stake in Canadian Pacific helped send the stock up 3/4 to 22, a 52-week high, as 2.5 million shares changed hands. 
Talk of a possible restructuring also contributed to the advance. 

   Lyondell Petrochemical dropped 1/2 to 22 1/4 on 2.1 million shares. 
Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate of 1989 earnings by 9%, based on "industry factors related to volume and margins," according to the company. 

   Sterling Chemicals fell 5/8 to 9 3/8 in active trading after its earnings for the June quarter turned out to be well short of analysts' forecasts. 
Other stocks hurt by disappointing quarterly results included Norsk Hydro, which went down 1 1/2 to 22; Great American Bank, down 2 1/4 to 10 1/2, and Allied Products, down 3 1/4 to 14 3/8. 

   But Digital Equipment rose 7/8 to 92 3/8 even though earnings for the June quarter were on the low end of expectations and the company cautioned analysts that results for the fiscal year ending next June will depend on the U.S. economy's performance. 

   In their first appearance on the S&amp;P 500, United Telecommunications Technology advanced 3 1/2 to 73 1/4 and Tyco Laboratories gained 2 to 44 7/8. 
Typically, stocks new to the index attract buying interest from managers of index funds, portfolios designed to mirror the movements of a given market measure. 

   The American Stock Exchange Index set another all-time high by gaining 2.57 to 375.35. 
Volume totaled 14,790,000 shares. 

   Healthcare International plummeted 2 1/8 to 1 3/4 after a management group's proposal for a leveraged buy-out collapsed. 
Healthvest dropped 3 5/8 to 10 1/4; Healthcare International has a 9.8% stake in the partnership and would have spun it off to shareholders in the buy-out.

   Scientists at the National Insitutes of Health reported encouraging results from their trial of the drug DDI in patients with AIDS and severe AIDS-related complex. 

   Publication of the report in the journal Science today comes shortly after the U.S. recorded its 100,000th case of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
More than half that number have died. 

   The DDI study has become the focus of enormous hope and political activity. 
The drug is seen as a potential boon to the 40% to 80% of AIDS patients who cannot tolerate the drug AZT, which is made by a unit of Wellcome PLC. AZT is the only antiviral drug approved for treatment of AIDS, but it can cause a severe anemia that can force patients to end the treatment. 

   DDI, which was developed by the National Cancer Institute and licensed to Bristol-Myers Co., is a chemical cousin of AZT. 
Both are classed as "nucleoside analogues," or false building blocks of DNA that insert themselves into the virus and interrupt its replication. 
However, doctors haven't seen anything like AZT's toxicity in studies of DDI so far. 

   The scientists said DDI was given for 42 weeks to 26 patients. 
They noted evidence of improved immune function, including rises in both T4 and T8 lymphocytes, types of white blood cells involved in fighting infection. 
The patients also showed decreases of 80% in their blood levels of virus and experienced mean weight gains of about 3.5 pounds. 
More than half the group said their energy levels improved. 
Patients at the highest dosage levels enjoyed the greatest improvements. 

   Six patients in the study developed opportunistic infections, and one patient who started on the lowest dosage level died. 
Side effects included rises in uric acid, mild headaches and insomnia. 
Two out of a larger group of 45 developed pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas. 
"This is a warning that this drug has to be treated with respect," said the paper's senior author, Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute. 
"So far, it {hasn't limited use of DDI}. 
But at higher doses or more chronic uses, it'll have to be watched." 
He added that patients should avoid alcohol while taking DDI. 

   The study, co-authored by Robert Yarchoan and colleagues at the cancer institute, was a phase-one study, designed to determine safety and dosage levels. 

   As the phase-one trial has proceeded, DDI has become a rallying point for groups pressing for faster, broader distribution of experimental agents. 
The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power negotiated with officials of Bristol-Myers to obtain a promise that DDI would be available to people who couldn't participate in clinical trials. 

   Bristol management has said it will give the drug to patients in critical need even if they don't qualify for entry into a studies of more than 1,200 people that are scheduled to start in September, when scientists launch the second phase of clinical trials designed to determine whether DDI is effective. 
Such programs have heightened urgency in view of the fact that bootleg DDI is being advertised for sale by mail-order entrepreneurs in Florida. 

   Finally, the criteria for determining effectiveness are becoming a point of scientific and social debate. 
In the AZT trial in 1986, an untreated control group suffered many more infections and deaths than the AZT group, thus proving the drug worked to preserve health and prolong life for some patients. 
But increasingly some scientists and activists are questioning the harsh necessity of using death as the sole endpoint of a trial. 

   Other factors short of death -- such as changes in T4 cells and in virus levels -- are being discussed as alternative criteria. 
Such factors should be given weight, Dr. Broder asserted, along with reversal of AIDS dementia in adults and neurological problems in children. 
But he added that "the jury is still out" on the question of whether such softer criteria are enough to secure the Food and Drug Administration's approval for DDI or for any other drug.

<TEXT>
   including 15 years as an employee of International Dairy Queen, and for the past three years, a "territory operator" -- I feel I am qualified to comment on the July 6 article "When Franchisees Go Their Own Way." 

   While the tenor of the article seems to be one of portraying Dairy Queen as a group in turmoil made up of fractious people intent on doing things their own way, I must disagree, and from my perspective suggest that one of the great things about DQ is the willingness of both sides to listen and react to each other. 
This ability to react has created a chain that is remarkably free of the "red ink" one sees in many of the chains listed in the article. 
It seems as if one cannot pick up a trade publication these days without getting the latest tale of woe on chains that are retrenching, laying off, closing units, dealing with disgruntled franchisees or stockholders in the courts -- or just generally being involved in all kinds of nonproductive activity. 
Fortunately at DQ, we who sit on the dealer councils are able to spend time on how we can improve the stores and listen and learn from each other. 

   Finally, the comments of John Campbell are amusing. 
I had an office two doors down from him when he was at International Dairy Queen, and am tempted to paraphrase the old saw: "He who can, does. 
He who cannot, consults."

   Assets of the 467 money-market mutual funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute grew $1.85 billion, to $332.78 billion, during the week ended Wednesday. 

   "Even though inflows of new money continued, the rate of increase has slowed markedly in recent weeks reflecting the gradual downward drift in short-term interest rates," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist of the Washington trade group. 

   Institutional investors pulled $313.2 million out of 141 funds, during the week, dropping assets to $84.79 billion. 
This was attributed to the "sharp mid-week narrowing of yield spreads on institutional funds over Treasury bills," said Mr. Dreyer. 

   Individuals continued to add money to funds, however. 
The 231 general-purpose funds the Institute tracks grew $554.8 million, to $105.96 billion, while 95 brokerdealer funds increased $1.6 billion, to $142.03 billion. 

   Yields on money funds dropped again in the week ended Tuesday, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a newsletter. 
For the first time since February, the average seven-day compounded yield fell below 9%. 
The average fund pays 8.97%, down from 9.03% the week before.

   Having supplied your readers with a witty and insightful article on some developers' determination to leave their mark on history by erecting the world's tallest building (July 7), I hope you will follow up with an article examining an important corollary issue. 
How will we ever get rid of such monstrosities when they reach the end of their useful lives? 

   Even if the materials used to construct 100-story-plus buildings last forever -- which is doubtful -- it's unlikely that the design concepts on which they're based will prove equally long-lived. 
If, as your article indicates, construction costs per square foot rise dramatically as building height soars, one can only imagine what happens to demolition costs.

   Rupert Murdoch's News America Publishing Inc. said it has ceased negotiations with Solomon Equities, developer of a Manhattan office building where Mr. Murdoch's company was considering leasing about one million square feet of space. 

   The deal, in a 42-story office tower now under construction at 1585 Broadway just north of Times Square, would have been the biggest real estate transaction of the year in New York. 

   A spokesman for News America said, "There was a letter of agreement signed by both principals, and the Murdoch organization was ready, willing and able to proceed. 
Solomon indicated they were not prepared to proceed, and since that time, there have been no further discussions between Solomon Equities and News America." 

   "Mr. 
Solomon walked from the table," said Kenneth D. Laub, real estate broker for News America. 
He added, "My client was amazed, after negotiating for six months in extraordinarily good faith, that the developer would change the terms and conditions of the deal." 

   Mr. Solomon said his policy is not to comment on the progress of lease negotiations. 
However, he did say he is talking to a number of prospective tenants, including News America. 
He said 1585 Broadway is "a good product with good financing and I'm not worried or concerned about filling it." 

   News America is the U.S. arm of Australia-based News Corp. 
Its publications include TV Guide, Seventeen, Premier and New York magazines, the Boston Herald and the Star supermarket tabloid. 

   The company, which operates out of several New York locations is planning to consolidate. 
The firm is considering sites in New York and New Jersey, the spokesman said. 
Another option would be to divide its approximately 1,200 employees between those locations. 

   The aborted News America deal has attracted attention in the local real estate market for a number of reasons. 
The high-profile tenant's space needs are substantially larger than those of most businesses in the city, and the deal would be twice the size of many deals that are considered big. 

   Also, a News America lease on Manhattan's West Side would help fill a big block of the city's newly built office space. 
It would be a boost to owners of half a dozen new, and still vacant, buildings nearby that couldn't accommodate the publishing concern but would like to have it as a neighbor. 

   Individuals familiar with the talks say the deal hit a snag in recent weeks because Solomon was unable to secure permanent financing on the building given the proposed length and value of the Murdoch lease. 

   A real estate developer will typically finance new building construction with a short-term construction loan at a relatively high interest rate. 
Then, with a major tenant on board, the developer secures longer-term financing at a slightly lower interest rate from an insurance company, pension fund or foreign bank. 
Then the initial loan is paid off. 

   In theory, such financing should be obtainable for a fully leased Manhattan office building because there's more money available than there are quality properties in which to invest. 
In reality, however, each side -- the developer, lender and possibly the tenant, as well -- can reach a dead end when they try to agree on how much equity each will retain in the building. 

   Industry sources suggest that the proposed deal may have provided insufficient rental revenue to the developer to safely cover his debt service and operating expenses. 
If so, lenders may have found the project too risky to finance and sought more equity to compensate for its risk. 

   Mr. Solomon, however, denied that he is concerned about getting sufficient financing or attracting a tenant. 
He said he has a seven-year construction loan on the property and points out that many top-notch tenants are currently in the market for newly constructed office space. 

   Negotiations for the News America lease were complicated by the presence of another major tenant with claims to the property. 
Last fall, the law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn signed a lease for 426,000 square feet smack in the middle of the 1.3 million square-foot building. 
Many observers viewed that transaction as a coup for Solomon Equities, a young company headed by Mr. Solomon and his wife, Jean. 
The couple had taken on considerable risk by building three Manhattan office buildings without prior tenant commitments. 

   The arrival of another prestigious tenant, News America, seeking almost the entire building, provided an ironic twist; the law firm lease suddenly became more of a problem than a prize. 

   Aside from negotiating with the developer, Murdoch representatives found themselves trying to cut a deal with the law firm to buy it out of its lease before it even moved into the building. 
The firm is slated to move in sometime next year. 
"They {News America} did approach us several times," said Herbert Weinstein, chairman of Proskauer's real estate department. 
He describes those meetings as "very preliminary, but its clear they were willing to offer significant bucks." 
He declined to put a dollar amount on the offer. 

   The city's real estate brokers began buzzing about what it would mean to have the law firm back in the market and imagining how the pieces of the new puzzle would fit together. 
To help Proskauer avoid realizing a capital gain on the sale of its lease, they reasoned, News America might take additional space elsewhere, then sublease the new space to Proskauer. 
The law firm would in turn sublease its space in Solomon's building to News America. 
But now the law firm is planning to move in next spring, and these other ideas remain scribbles on a napkin at a power lunch.

   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said pretax profit rose 14% in the second quarter, to #483 million ($804.2 million) from #425 million a year earlier. 

   The British concern's sales grew 17%, to #3.43 billion ($5.71 billion) from #2.93 billion, boosted by increases in both volume and price and by exchange-rate factors. 

   For the first half, pretax profit rose 18%, to #925 million from #783 million, and sales increased 13%, to #6.64 billion from #5.87 billion. 
Profit attributable to shareholders, or net income, grew 32% for the half, to #562 million from #425 million in the corresponding year-earlier period. 
There were no one-time charges in the latest half. 
In the year-earlier six months, the company's results included a #44 million extraordinary loss.

   Knight-Ridder Inc. promoted three of its top executives in a move that the newspaper company said "expresses confidence" in the outcome of a pending court decision involving the company's Detroit paper. 

   Richard G. Capen Jr., 55 years old, publisher and chairman of the Miami Herald, was named vice chairman of Knight-Ridder. 
Succeeding him will be David Lawrence Jr., 47, publisher and chairman of the Detroit Free Press. 
Robert J. Hall, 44, president of the Free Press, will succeed Mr. Lawrence. 

   The Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal from an ad hoc Michigan citizens group opposed to the plan to operate jointly parts of the Free Press and Gannett Co.'s Detroit News. 
Mr. Lawrence played a central role in guiding the Free Press through its planned operating agreement with the News. 
James K. Batten, Knight-Ridders's president and chief executive officer, said Mr. Hall now "will be the leader the Free Press needs and deserves as we push to the end" of the Supreme Court's review. 

   Mr. Capen will have responsibility for operations of Knight-Ridder's Business Information Services division and the company's cable-television operations, as well as assuming new responsibilities in the area of public affairs.

<HL> Plastics Industry Uses Marketing Tactic
@  To Tell Public Products Are Recyclable

   The plastics industry is betting that a new marketing ploy will convince Americans that plastic food containers are recyclable and thus don't add to the nation's solid-waste crisis. 

   Millions of plastic containers with funny little triangles molded into them are starting to show up on America's grocery shelves. 
Inside the triangle, which generally appears at the bottom of the container, is a number from one to seven. 
The number identifies the container's plastic resin or resins, thereby indicating whether it's a candidate for recycling. 

   The industry claims that roughly 90% of all plastic bottles are either a one (for polyethylene terephlate, or PETE) or a two (for high density polyethylene, or HDPE). 
Both are recyclable. 

   So far, the ploy is working. 
Seventeen states have incorporated part or all of the code into their state regulations. 
As devised by the Society of Plastics Industry, a trade group, the code is intended to cover all bottles and jars of 16 ounces or more, plus other containers having at least an eight-ounce capacity. 
Deadlines for implementation currently vary from Connecticut's Jan. 1, 1990, to Iowa's July 1, 1992. 
The most populous state, California, has set a Jan. 1, 1992, deadline. 

   Many big consumer-product concerns have adopted the code. 
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., for instance, says 90% of its plastic containers now carry the code, although the Cincinnati-based concern adds that it will take another six to nine months to work off its pre-code inventory. 
"There are products (in coded bottles) out there now, and you'll soon see a lot more," says a P&amp;G spokesman, rattling off such household staples as Tide, Cheer, Jif peanut butter and Crisco oil. 

   In New York, Colgate-Palmolive Co. says its newly coded plastic bottles have started reaching stores. 
Such familiar items as Fab and Dynamo 2 laundry detergent, and Palmolive and Ajax dishwashing liquid, are affected. 
In Pittsburgh, meanwhile, H.J. Heinz Co. says it started turning out ketchup bottles bearing the code about six weeks ago; they'll be in supermarkets within eight weeks, a spokesman adds. 

   Fast-food chains are gearing up, too. 
That's not surprising given that fast-food packaging has been the focus of the bans that some 30 states and dozens of communities have either passed or have under consideration. 
PepsiCo Inc.'s Kentucky Fried Chicken division, for example, says it will start coding its food containers and bucket lids sometime next year. 

   Fast-food packaging, however, probably will remain a heated political issue. 
That's because such packaging is made from polystyrene, which will carry a code number of six. 
While a Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman acknowledges that polystyrene still isn't yet recyclable, he stresses that new technology is being developed and the company expects polystyrene to be recylable before 1995. 

   Separately, motor oil sold by Du Pont Co.'s Conoco unit now carries the triangular marking, a reflection of giant Du Pont's fear of plastic bans. 
"The public's distrust of our business threatens our industry," Nicholas Pappas, a Du Pont executive vice president, recently told an industry conference. 
"We shouldn't let the environmentalists take the high ground," he said. 
"We give a damn about the environment." 

   PETE is what most soda bottles are made of, while HDPE is commonly used to make milk jugs. 
Under the coding system, three is for vinyl, while four is for low-density polyethylene. 
Five is for polypropylene, while six is for the dreaded polystyrene. 
Seven, meanwhile, is simply for "other." 

   One "other" that's been catching a lot of flak is Heinz's ketchup bottle, which contains 6% ethyl vinyl alcohol to prevent oxygen permeation. 
While acknowledging that Heinz has been singled out for having a bottle that isn't readily recyclable, the company spokesman says that consumers are more interested in product freshness, and that Heinz has no current plans to change the bottle's formulation. 

   The coding system is just one of a number of ways the plastics industry is fighting to keep plastic packaging from being banned. 
Another is an industry-funded research program for developing products that use recycled plastic. 
Park benches and flower pots are among the program's first successes.

<HL> Sears Tries to Update Image by Using
@  Du Pont High-Tech Furniture Material

   As part of its strategy to remake its dowdy image by adding well-known brand names to its merchandise mix, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. has turned to the furniture floor. 

   This fall, it will introduce a collection of 11 upholstered sofas and chairs that employ a high-tech seating-support material developed by Du Pont Corp. 

   But Sears, Chicago, has taken on a tough sell: It will have to convince consumers that a woven fabric stretched across the furniture frame is as strong as the traditional springs, webbing and other upholstery innards it replaces. 
Thus far, a few furniture makers have been willing to try the new material called Dymetrol that Du Pont brought out last year. 

   "This is a breakthrough technology . . . but the furniture industry hasn't moved quickly on this," concedes Dan Schmierer, a manager at Du Pont. 
"We think we can make it more visible through Sears." 

   Even furniture makers who applaud the product admit that it isn't winning rave reviews among consumers. 
For instance, John Bost, director of manufacturing at Carson's Inc., which has installed the fabric in about 10% of its sofas, love seats and chairs, says that "not only does it sit well-comfortable and firm, but it really is resilient. . . . 
We're sold on it." 
But Mr. Bost says his retail dealers are having trouble persauding consumers. 

   The problem is that once shoppers remove the seat cushions and discover that there's nothing that looks sturdy supporting the furniture, they believe it is cheaply made. 
"You still have to convince homeowners that this (Dymetrol) performs better than springs," Mr. Bost says. 

   Industry experts also say that Sears, which of late has been stressing its "everyday low prices," may be hindered in its ability to sell its line, which it has positioned as more fashionable and more expensive than the typical furniture it sells. 
For example, a three-piece sectional couch is about $1,700. 
Sears' typical sectional couches sell in the $1,000 to $1,400 range. 

   Despite the challenges, Sears dominance in selling furniture -- its annual furniture sales are estimated at more than $1 billion -- is such that analysts say the nation's biggest retailer is well-poised to win over skeptical consumers. 
"Sears has the clout and the credibility when it comes to furniture," says Jerry Epperson, a securities analyst at Wheat First Securities. 

   Sears and Du Pont introduced the Lasting Images furniture line at the American Craft Museum here in a model living room similar to the ones that will be set up this fall in 450 of Sears' larger stores. 

   To help explain the product, Sears will install television monitors playing videotapes which show a man poking slits through the furniture fabric with a knife. 
The demonstrator then jumps up and down on the furniture to illustrate Du Pont's claims that the woven product is "six times more durable than typical spring construction."

   Palmer Financial Corp., controlled by Tampa investor Hugh F. Culverhouse, said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board approved its application to acquire Coast Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Sarasota, Fla. 

   The company said the Bank Board's approval is subject to certain conditions, which Palmer Financial and Mr. Culverhouse are reviewing. 
A decision on Palmer's ability to comply with the conditions will be made on or before next Monday, the company said. 

   Mr. Culverhouse called off a previous $20-a-share, or $71.9 million, merger pact with Coast Federal in November, citing conditions required by the Bank Board to approve the transaction. 

   He returned earlier this year with a lower, hostile tender offer of $60 million, or $15 a share, which Coast Federal has been trying to fend off. 

   In February, Coast sued Mr. Culverhouse to halt the tender offer by alleging that he and Palmer violated securities laws through a series of misrepresentations and omissions in its tender offer disclosure materials. 
But Palmer said it already has more of the company's stock than it needs to complete the tender offer.

   Like so many sheep, investors love to be led. 

   That isn't news to people like Joseph Granville, Robert Prechter and Elaine Garzarelli; they took turns leading investors in and out of the stock market in the past decade or so. 
Stocks are cheap, they would say, and investors would dutifully flock to their brokers. 
Or their negative signals would cause floods of sales. 

   But one by one, those gurus stumbled or faded from view. 
Mr. Prechter, for example, the "Elliott Wave" theorist who became a hero during the bull market of the mid-1980s, was calling for the Dow Jones Industrial Average to hit 3600 just before the stock market crashed. 

   Now investors are scrambling to find their next leader. 
"People have an absolutely insatiable desire for simple answers to the complex questions of life," says Charles Minter of Comstock Partners, a New York investment firm. 
"Everybody wants the secret." 

   So who are the investment professionals following these days? 
How about Boston money manager and trader Gerald R. Jordan Jr. 
While hardly a household name, he has been called the best stock-market timer in Boston. 
Or Steven C. Leuthold, a Minneapolis strategist who gives portfolio advice to many of the country's biggest pension funds. 

   Like many of Wall Street's past gurus, these strategists rely on a heavy dose of technical indicators, numerical measures that help project market trends. 
Unfortunately, the conclusions they reach vary markedly. 

   Mr. Jordan thinks the Dow industrials are headed over 3000 sometime next year. 
But Ned Davis, a highly regarded Florida adviser, is bearish about the next year and suggests that clients increase their cash positions. 

   As yet, none of these three necessarily moves the stock market. 
But they force the pros to rethink portfolios, look up from their computer screens and sometimes change their trading. 

   Here's a look at the three. 

   NED DAVIS: Mr. Davis isn't interested in being a guru, thank you. 
He'd rather sell analytical work. 
That's where the money is. 

   "We really try to downplay our forecasting," the 44-year-old adviser says. 
"You make a bad forecast and your business is down the tubes." 
So Mr. Davis sells reams of charts and graphs on several hundred market indicators to almost 500 institutional clients. 

   But many market pros happily pay Mr. Davis for his predictions. 
"Historically he's been very, very accurate," says George Neisloss, head trader for the Connecticut state pension fund. 
"I use his type of service to give me a framework so that I can be more aggressive or less aggressive in buying." 

   Mr. Davis's service, Ned Davis Research Inc., Nokomis, Fla., combines technical indicators, like the percentage of stocks that advance each day compared with those that decline, and fundamental indicators like Federal Reserve Board monetary policy. 
The goal: avoiding mistakes. 
"A client once said to us that he couldn't remember any big mistakes we had made," Mr. Davis recalls. 
"That was the biggest compliment that he could give us." 

   The technical indicators allow the firm to determine where to place "stop-loss" orders, which tell investors when to sell if the market is falling. 
This keeps the mistakes small and cuts losses. 
That way, clients can change strategy based on a new set of signals. 

   Mr. Davis currently is bearish for the stock market's outlook over the next year or so. 
That conclusion is based on feeble money-supply growth, a wariness about the Federal Reserve and a look at retail sales. 

   Mr. Davis's firm did a study of retail sales over seven-year periods and determined that in no such period has the consumer ever bought more (on a unit basis) than he did in the past seven years. 
"It looks to us like the consumer is pretty much tapped out," he says. 

   But that doesn't mean the firm is steering clear of stocks. 
Armed with a forecast that interest rates have one or two percentage points further to decline, Mr. Davis is buying such interest-rate-sensitive stocks as utilities and high-quality financial stocks. 
In the bond market, he likes quality government issues and the highest-grade corporates. 
Stay away from the stocks of auto makers, paper companies and commodity producers, he argues. 

   And even though the Dow Jones industrials have ploughed through the 2525 target Mr. Davis earlier predicted would be the high for the year, he isn't bearish for the short-term. 
That's where the technical indicators come in. 
"We'll stay in it as long as the trend is up," he says. 
GERALD R. JORDAN JR.: If Boston money manager Jerry Jordan asks for your feelings about the market, don't be flattered, says fellow institutional investor Kenneth Heebner. 
"You're just another vote." 

   And don't be insulted if Mr. Jordan bets the opposite way from your vote and others. 
"He has an incredible ability to take the emotion out of the market," Mr. Heebner says. 

   Mr. Jordan, the president of Hellman, Jordan Management Co., bought his first stock, Bowlmor, for $1.50 a share when he was 13 years old. 
"It went to $26, and I have been absolutely enamored of the stock market ever since," he says. 
While others read novels, Mr. Jordan reads about the market. 
Or market sentiment. 
Or interest rates. 

   And it's his psychological makeup that often offers the best investment advice. 
"When the market has been going down for a while, I usually feel awful emotionally," the 50-year-old Harvard graduate says. 
But that's the best time to buy stocks. 
So Mr. Jordan learned "that when people throw in the psychological towel," he should muster the courage to buy. 

   That type of talk might sound too touchy-feely for the numbers-crunching world of Wall Street, but Mr. Jordan's arrows on market directions point to some strong moves. 

   His expectations: a bull market in bonds, coupled with strong upward moves for the dollar (look for parity with the British pound in the early 1990s) and a continuing rise in stock prices. 
Mr. Jordan expects to see 30-year Treasury bonds yielding about 6 3/4% sometime next year. 
"I think that will be good enough to take the Dow by that time over 3000," he contends. 

   The Federal Reserve will be forced to ease monetary policy as the economy weakens, his thesis goes, which will bring lower interest rates. 
"If my expectations on interest rates come to pass, people will be forced into the stock market," he says. 
With lower rates, "we're running out of places for people to invest." 

   STEVEN C. LEUTHOLD: Ask Steve Leuthold where the stock market will be headed for in the next month or two, and he might refer you to Evel Knutson, a fictitious Norwegian daredevil-guru. 
According to Evel, investors should forget about the Elliott Wave Theory, the popular technical thesis used by such analysts as Mr. Prechter. 
Evel employs the "permanent wave theory" in his market forecasts. 

   Says Mr. Leuthold, "I'm just trying to point out that it's absurd for a serious person in the investment business to divine where the market is going in the next month or so." 

   But his Minneapolis firm, Leuthold Group, gets some seriously high marks from portfolio managers. 
"He's listened to by a lot of us portfolio types," says Richard Fontaine, who runs a money-management firm in Baltimore. 

   Central to Mr. Leuthold's success is his ability to change the indicators he watches. 
"You can find the keys for a while, then conditions change and sort of turn the old rules upside down," he says. 
"If cash flow becomes a more important thing than earnings and is making investors react, then we'll start factoring that in." 
The place to start, of course, is to create a history for the indicator, which allows Mr. Leuthold to gather perspective. 

   But he is uncomfortable if his views agree with the consensus. 
That's why he is now taking a hard look at science and technology stocks. 
"They're very out of focus, and eventually science and technology will be popular again," he says. 

   In keeping with that, the firm's largest position is stock-market laggard International Business Machines Corp., which makes up 7% of the portfolio. 
His worry: "We try to anticipate, so we're occasionally early. 
That's both a virtue and a vice." 

   Indeed, Mr. Leuthold turned bearish too early in 1987 and took heat from some clients as the Dow Jones industrials rocketed past 2700. 
But he was redeemed when his advice proved sage in light of the crash. 

   Making mistakes is part of the advisory business, Mr. Leuthold realizes. 
Each year, he sends clients a review of the errors he and his staffers have made. 
"It keeps us all from getting too taken with our work."

   Black Enterprise magazine, published by a friend of former housing Secretary Samuel Pierce, received at least $55,000 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in an unprecedented advertising deal, newly obtained documents show. 

   The 1986 federal expenditure, at a time when HUD was slashing public-affairs staff and spending, occurred over the vociferous objections of several agency staffers. 
"There was a big fight over it," recalls Robert Nipp, a HUD spokesman. 

   Mr. Pierce's direct involvement in helping his friend Earl Graves provides further evidence that Mr. Pierce wasn't always a "hands-off" manager, which is how he described himself at a congressional hearing in May and that he interceded on behalf of friends and minority developers. 

   Separately, one of the congressional panels investigating the HUD scandal is delving into connections between Lance Wilson, Mr. Pierce's first executive assistant, and a developer in Fort Worth, Texas. 
Mr. Wilson helped win HUD approval for a controversial project pushed by the developer, Leonard Briscoe, HUD officials said. 
After Mr. Wilson left the government, he received a 15% financial interest in another project sponsored by Mr. Briscoe, according to project records. 

   Mr. Wilson is scheduled to testify before the employment and housing subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee today. 

   The $55,000 spent by HUD on an eight-page "advertorial" in the May 1986 issue of Mr. Graves's magazine was augmented by $35,000 from the National Association of Real Estate Brokers Inc., a trade association of black real-estate agents and developers. 
The advertising spread promoted the "partnership" between HUD and the association, with pictures of Mr. Pierce and the group's president at the time, T.L. Holmes. 
The text focused on the association's efforts to promote minority homeownership. 

   "It helped get our story across," Mr. Holmes said. "'Black Enterprise' is the bible for the black entrepreneur," he added. 
The advertising "did a lot for our esteem and membership," Mr. Holmes said. 

   It is unclear what benefit HUD derived from the venture. 
Mr. Nipp said the unusual and expensive advertising project was pushed at HUD by Bernice Williams, who headed the department's office for assisting minority businesses. 
When the public-affairs staff, which supervised the department's advertising, opposed the large expenditure, Ms. Williams went directly to Mr. Pierce and won his approval, Mr. Nipp said. 

   In a "Dear Earl" letter to Mr. Graves, Deborah Gore Dean, Mr. Pierce's powerful executive assistant, authorized the $55,000 expenditure in January 1986. 
In April, Black Enterprise billed HUD for $66,987, which included extra charges for layout and production. 

   Mr. Graves has been a friend of Mr. Pierce for years, according to Carolyn Odom, a Black Enterprise employee. 
Messrs. 
Graves and Pierce both are veterans of the civil-rights movement and New York politics. 
Ms. Odom described Black Enterprise as an "upscale" magazine for black entrepreneurs, with 230,000 subscribers 

   Former HUD officials said the two men were close, and Mr. Graves in 1981 called Mr. Pierce's appointment as HUD secretary a "real victory" for black people. 

   Mr. Graves didn't return messages, and Ms. Williams couldn't be reached for comment. 
Mr. Pierce and Ms. Dean have repeatedly refused requests for comment. 

   Mr. Pierce and Ms. Dean had frequent dealings with Mr. Holmes's real estate organization, according to newly released HUD documents. 
In June 1986, Ms. Dean approved spending $1,000 for an advertisement in a souvenir program for the real-estate brokers association's annual convention. 
Ms. Dean received an award at the convention. 
In December 1986, Mr. Holmes sent her a plant and fruit basket for Christmas, according to the documents. 

   The group also participated in several HUD programs. 
In January 1984, Mr. Pierce backed the group's proposal for a program to boost minority home-ownership. 
He urged the Federal National Mortgage Association to commit $100 million to the program, in which minority developers and real-estate brokers association members received loans to build minority housing in 21 cities. 
The real-estate brokers group also acted as a clearinghouse for black developers interested in purchasing foreclosed HUD properties, according to Mr. Holmes and HUD documents. 

   Mr. Wilson helped win approval for a $7 million HUD Urban Development Action Grant for a housing project in Fort Worth built by Mr. Briscoe. 
Officials in HUD's regional office in Fort Worth "strongly recommended that it not be approved," said Walter Sevier, HUD's deputy regional administrator in Fort Worth. 

   Among the regional office's objections were the project's high rents, the density of federal housing projects in the area and Mr. Briscoe's lack of private equity, Mr. Sevier explained. 
Last week, the project went into foreclosure, according to Mr. Sevier. 

   Mr. Wilson overrode the Fort Worth housing officials and approved the grant, Mr. Sevier said. 
Mr. Wilson couldn't be reached for comment. 

   In May 1986, almost two years after he left HUD, Mr. Wilson received a 15% interest in a $24 million HUD-backed project that Mr. Briscoe's development group built in Riviera Beach, Fla., with another urban development grant. 
Earlier this month, Mr. Wilson told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, which first reported the relationship between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Briscoe, that he hadn't received any profits from the project. 

   A HUD internal audit of the Riviera Beach project obtained by The Wall Street Journal under the Freedom of Information Act said the development group overcharged HUD $3.5 million on the project and refused admission to families receiving federal housing assistance who wanted to live in the 520-unit apartment complex. 
Mr. Briscoe didn't return calls.

   How rich do Holiday's executives want to get, and how fast? 

   That's the question facing investors in Holiday, the giant hotel and casino operator. 
After Nov. 11 Holiday's senior executives, who already own about 5% of the Memphis, Tenn., company, can immediately double their holdings under a 1986 recapitalization plan -- but only if they agree to sell the company. 
That's obviously a powerful incentive, especially in view of the high prices foreign investors have paid for some U.S. lodging concerns. 

   So powerful, in fact, that takeover speculation has more than doubled Holiday's share price this year, with the stock soaring more than 25% just this month. 
Holiday closed yesterday at 67 1/8, up 4, on heavy volume. 

   The stock benefits were promised to Holiday's top executives as "golden handcuffs" to entice them to stay at the company. 
The shares available to the executives were scheduled to build up over eight years through 1995, with a sizable penalty if the company changed ownership before this November. 
But a clause in the agreement lets management sell the company after Nov. 11 and immediately receive all the shares due them -- even if the executives acquire the company themselves in a leveraged buy-out. 

   Although a sale this fall would probably reap Holiday's executives more than $350 million between them, some analysts say management may opt to shoot for an even bigger payoff later. 
The company, since increasing its debt to $2.8 billion in a move meant to fend off raiders, has sold 66 hotels at unexpectedly high prices, while retaining the management contracts on them, analysts say. 
Holiday has used the sale proceeds to reduce debt by some $900 million. 
Now, some analysts predict Holiday, as it lowers debt further and narrows its focus to managing hotels and casinos, can continue rising in value. 

   "I don't see any evidence that says management is necessarily intent on selling Holiday," said analyst Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns. 
"I'm a little bit concerned that the Street is putting two and two together and getting six." 

   A Holiday spokesman says the company won't comment on movement in its stock or on speculation about possible transactions. 
Asked about a recent statement by analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel Burnham Lambert that Holiday officials have said they aren't ruling out a sale, the spokesman called this assertion "Dan Lee's statement. 
I don't know who he's talking about." 

   In the past year, several U.S. hotel chains have been sold for huge premiums to Japanese, Hong Kong and British buyers. 
Analysts say the offshore investors enjoy more favorable "goodwill" accounting rules that enable them to pay higher prices for the chains than U.S. companies can bear. 
"I think lodging concerns would be foolish not to consider some sort of transaction to realize these kinds of values," said Napoleon Overton, an analyst with Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. 

   According to Joseph Doyle of Smith Barney, Harris Upham, foreign interests have paid between 14 and 20 times previous-year's cash flow for such chains as Grand Metropolitan PLC's Intercontinental Hotels unit, Ramada Inc. and UAL's Westin Hotels. 
Holiday, itself, sold Holiday International to Bass PLC for about 14 times "trailing" cash flow, he said. 
Hilton Hotels, whose management indicated in May that it might sell the company, now is trading around 16 times its expected cash flow this year, he said. 

   Given these multiples, "I think Holiday management would consider selling for in excess of $100 a share," says Mr. Doyle, "but I don't think an offer of that size will come forth." 
Other analysts say the company could see a bid in the mid-70s or higher. 
Mr. Doyle says the $100-a-share price -- plus Holiday's roughly $80 a share of debt -- is about 11 times Holiday's expected cash flow this year. 
Currently, he says, Holiday is trading at about nine times expected cash flow. 

   Some institutional investors also praised Holiday's upside potential. 
"They're the only gaming company with casinos in all five gaming areas in Nevada and New Jersey, and they have the No. 1 suites concept with Embassy Suites," says an analyst for a large fund that holds about a million Holiday shares. 
"You're talking about a company that's still at a 60% discount to its asset values." 

   A Holiday competitor, naturally, sees things differently. 
Michael Leven, president and chief operating officer of Days Inns of America Corp., says, "All my research numbers say they're losing market share in their core {Holiday Inns} brand"something Holiday denies. 
"If I were sitting in the offices there and I had a chance to make that kind of money, I'd sell the company."

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Tom Foley is starting to talk compromise on a cut in the capital-gains tax, floating the idea of indexing capital gains to avoid taxing illusory, inflation-driven gains. 
Seems only fair. 
And as the bargaining gets serious, someone needs to get on the table the next point of equity, equal treatment for capital gains and capital losses. 
This is important because even in Congress the merits of the issue are not totally irrelevant. 

   Indeed, bargaining is now opening because Mr. Foley, Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski have failed in their effort to ignore the merits and cast the issue solely in terms of party loyalty. 
Six Ways and Means Democrats are blocking their attempt to bottle the issue up in committee and avoid a floor vote they fear they would lose. 

   The six represent the more conservative and mostly Southern Democrats who have recently been frozen out in the party's leadership changes. 
Beyond that, they understand the issue well enough to know how much hot air there is in the "official" Democratic position that the benefits of a capital-gains cut would go only to "the rich." 
It's worth repeating that the numbers behind this assertion include the capital gain itself, and that a large share of gains are realized by taxpayers with very little ordinary income, mostly retirees cashing in lifetime gains (see chart). 
The six Democrats have all no doubt talked to an allegedly rich constituent who retired and sold his dry-cleaning shop. 

   Once the official-line Democrats are forced to debate the issue, their first recourse is indexing-adjusting the base of the capital gain for inflation. 
This is an obvious admission that in the grand "compromise" in the 1986 tax law, their price was not treating capital gains equally but treating them punitively. 
On the merits, there is no rationale whatever for taxing "income" that represents no addition to its recipient's command over real economic resources. 
If the gain on the asset is less than inflation, you can in fact be taxed on a real loss. 

   While the treatment of capital losses is not as widely recognized, it represents a similiar inequity. 
Wages and salaries do not usually go below zero, but capital assets can not only appreciate in value but also decline. 
If the appreciation of an asset is added to other income for tax purposes, its decline ought to be deducted from other income for tax purposes. 
But in fact, deductions of capital losses from ordinary income are limited to only $3,000 a year. 

   In other words, the government plays heads-I-win, tails-you-lose. 
If you have a loss, only the first $3,000 is "ordinary income." 
If you have a gain, "ordinary income" includes not only the first $3,000 but the whole thing. 
The administration and other supporters of a tax cut for capital gains need to start demanding some redress for this obvious inequity. 

   It's true, of course, that taxpayers have discretion about when to realize capital gains. 
Despite occasional assertions to the contrary, the ability to delay your gains has no great weight on the issue of equity; it's hard to buy anything with an unrealized capital gain. 
But if losses were fully deductible, taxpayers would have an incentive to realize them quickly. 

   Now, quick recognition of losses is not only good investment strategy but good economic strategy. 
Full deductibility would promote mobility of capital and efficient pricing of assets. 
It would obviously promote more venture capital, with high gains and high risks. 
Mere indexing, by contrast, would help the big and dull investments with low risks and humdrum rewards. 
But if full deductibility of losses would be good for economic growth, it would be "bad" in two other ways. 

   One is appearances. 
The truly rich sometimes have large capital losses, and these could be used to offset large income streams and pay "no tax." 
This happened during the Great Depression, which is the historical reason capital gains and losses are not treated symmetrically. 

   Full deductibility, secondly, would be bad for Treasury revenues. 
Not surprisingly, the heads-I-win, tails-you-lose approach is profitable for the IRS. Capital losses are far from rare, as stock market investors discovered in October 1987. 
Indeed, if gains do not greatly exceed losses, why tax capital gains at all? 
This is one large reason many nations do not. 

   Once the discussion gets down to the merits and all these issues are on the table, you start to understand why the traditional U.S. treatment has been excluding some more or less arbitary portion of capital gains from taxable income. 
Short of full indexing and full deductibility, this is a pretty good compromise itself.

<TEXT>
   How dare The Wall Street Journal overlook Tom Paine on its Bastille Day editorial page (July 14). 
Editorial top billing went, instead, to Paine's nemesis Edmund Burke, opponent of American independence, albeit sympathetic with many colonial causes. 

   While Burke deplored from afar the sanguinary wrongs in revolutionary France, Paine was on the scene, as one of only two foreign deputies to the French National Convention, doing his moral best to replicate the American revolutionary experience. 

   Publication of Paine's "Rights of Man" peaked the Paine-Burke feud by rattling the feudal shackles still extant in Britain. 
Paine was tried and convicted, in absentia, for his seditious frankness; possession of his influential pamphlet was made a crime. 
But the man on the street, in England as in France, understood and believed Tom Paine when he declared in his "Rights of Man," "Whatever is my right as man is also the right of another; and it becomes my duty to guarantee as well as to possess." 

   No wonder the key to the Bastille was entrusted to Paine by the Marquis de Lafayette, to be forwarded to George Washington, as a symbol of liberty. 

   Well said, Tom; the Journal's oversight stands corrected.

<DD> 07/27/89 </DD>

<TEXT>
   Regarding your June 21 article "The Working Woman's Nightmare": 

   I don't expect men to join the guilt-driven overwork syndrome we career women somehow accept from our own and society's demands. 
Laundry-pile neuroses and dust-ball anxiety are ailments women need to cure themselves of -- not spread to others. 
We have learned three-level market forecasting and sophisticated business strategies, but we have not yet replaced ourselves at the helm of home and family life. 
Performing that "second shift" poses a serious threat to women's physical and emotional health. 
The question of who will care for the family is such a serious one that many bright young career women and their husbands are deciding to forgo having children -- a decision that represents a loss to all of us. 

   Creating a warm and wonderful home environment is an important and time-consuming job. 
But who will give the necessary time and energy to the home is a key issue for this and future generations. 

   Any working mother certainly could have told the authors of "The Second Shift" that women give up leisure time to do housework, and men don't. 
A more important question than how to get men to do more is how to help women to do less, how to prevent them from curtailing almost all recreational time in favor of the necessary "second shift" for housework. 

   I suggest that a good part of the answer lies in hiring paid home workers. 
Almost all budgets can accommodate some type of household help, even if it is part time. 
It would be nice if each of us had a wife at home to anticipate and meet our needs, self-directed, self-motivated and unsalaried. 
But that is not possible for working mothers. 

   As I close this letter, I am snatching still-damp laundry from the dryer. 
Our home helper is on vacation, my son ran out of clean T-shirts for day camp, and I'm going to be late for work. 
I wish I had a wife]

   In your July 12 Managing column, it was pointed out that almost all "automated attendants" and "voice-processing" systems use a female voice. 
While you discuss that this is viewed as perpetuating stereotypes and slows women's progress, you also might have noted that for millions of hearing-impaired individuals who must struggle daily with the telephone, a female voice is usually 70% harder to understand than that of a male. 
This is because a large percentage of hearing loss is in the high-pitch range. 
Most of the companies utilizing these systems must want to communicate effectively with their callers. 
If so, they should do their homework, research the problem and learn that a male voice is often more readily understood by a larger part of the population. 
They should worry less about subtle backlash and aim for clearer speech. 

   Television producers, who insist upon turning up the volume of the background music so that the spoken word is lost in sound overload, and commercial advertisers might contact organizations or hire hearing-impaired consultants to review their products to see if it is possible to make these more readily understood.

@  Cleaning Up Problems From Reagan Era Drains

   "Some of us are like a shovel brigade that follows a parade down Main Street cleaning up," Donald Regan, White House chief of staff under President Reagan, once noted. 

   The Reagan brigades are gone now but the cleanup has barely begun, and President Bush will need regiments, entire divisions, to finish the job he has inherited from his predecessor. 

   "The chickens are coming home to roost," says Fred Greenstein, history professor at Princeton University. 

   "What we are left with," says Rudolph Penner, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, "is a government that is very constrained when it comes to taking care of serious problems." 

   And "the attention of the key people in this administration isn't so much forward looking but, instead, is dealing with the problems inherited from the past," says Murray Weidenbaum, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis and first chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. 

   The familiar problem is paying the interest on the long string of budget deficits run up during the Reagan years -- $1.3 trillion in all, with no end in sight. 
The year Mr. Reagan came to Washington, the federal debt was less than $800 billion. 
The year he left, it was about $2.2 trillion. 
In fiscal 1981, the government paid $69 billion in interest on the debt; this fiscal year, it will pay $169 billion. 

   "We've run up that debt and now we have to worry about servicing it," says John Palmer, dean of the Maxwell Graduate School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. 
"We've mortgaged the future." 

   But Reagan defenders say the problem is being greatly overstated. 
"Sure it's a problem finding money to do all these things," says Jeffrey Bell, a private economic consultant and a long-time advocate of supply-side economics. 
"But setting limits on growth was a part of the Reagan years. 
What we need to remember is that the Reagan expansion was one of the greatest success stories in American history." 
Mr. Bell says money can be squeezed out of the economy, without "significant" tax increases, to pay the nation's bills. 

   But now, added to the earlier budget woes is a major scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban Development that is consuming almost all of the time and the energies of Jack Kemp, the new HUD secretary, and the emergence of a whole set of problems that had been largely swept under the rug. 
These problems will cost hundreds of billions more to solve over the next decade or so. 
By some experts' estimates, they include: 

   --Bailing out the nation's failing savings-and-loan associations, which will cost at least $164 billion over the next 10 years. 

   --Modernization of the nation's rusting and dangerous nuclear-warhead plants and the cleanup of the mess they have created over the past 40 years, which will cost more than $200 billion. 

   --Repairs to bridges and maintenance of interstate highways, $300 billion. 

   --Renovation of crumbling public housing, $20 billion. 

   --Purchase of modern computers and a new long-distance phone system for federal bureaucracies, $15 billion. 

   --Modernization of the nation's overburdened air-traffic-control system, $25 billion. 

   That hardly begins to tell the story. 
From every side, legitimate interests demand more federal funding. 
The Defense Department seeks to push ahead with the Stealth bomber, at $530 million a copy, and the Strategic Defense Initiative, which the General Accounting Office says could eventually cost $1 trillion for the full system. 

   The GAO estimates that the Pentagon is planning on spending $200 billion more over the next five years to man its ships, build its planes and pay its personnel than the administration is prepared to seek. 

   The new defense secretary, Dick Cheney, is spending most of his time looking for ways to cut spending, including the elimination of whole classes of new weapons. 
But, says Mr. Penner, "the Congress is balking" at making the cuts. 

   Billions more are being sought to pay for long-term health care for the elderly, for treatment of AIDS patients, for housing for the homeless, for new federal prisons for a burgeoning jail population, for better schools for poor children, for deferred maintenance of the national parks, for cleaning up toxic-waste dumps, for sending a manned mission to Mars. 

   Abroad, nations struggling to achieve democratic reforms and others pleading for help to solve their huge debt problems look to the U.S. for help. 
But the cupboard is bare. 

   And "we have a president in George Bush who has vowed never to raise taxes," says Democratic Sen. Daniel Moynihan of New York. 
"He made a calculated decision to do nothing about these problems, and the pity is he didn't need to do it. 
He would have been elected anyway. 

   "It is an iron law of history," says Sen. Moynihan, "that power passes from debtor to creditor, and it is Ronald Reagan's legacy that we are a debtor nation." 
Mr. Moynihan notes that President Bush, visiting Poland and Hungary, could offer little more than "walking around money" to bolster the economies of those two nations. 

   Mr. Bell, the supply-sider, says the nation's drift into debtor status began under President Nixon and is largely "structural" in nature. 
But, he concedes, "Mr. 
Reagan didn't address it or try to correct it." 

   "Does this mean that the baton of leadership is going to be passed to other nations?" 
Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady last Wednesday. 

   "I must admit," replied Mr. Brady, "that from the point of view of the Treasury it is a source of some embarrassment in world-wide forums not to be able to come up with our agreed-to subscriptions to the World Bank and other multilateral institutions. 
I don't think we have a passing of the baton yet, but it is a serious worry." 

   No one lays the blame for all of these problems at the feet of Mr. Reagan. 
Congress shares a heavy burden, too. 
The criticism of the Reagan administration is that it did so little to solve them. 
"They inherited these problems," says Charles Bowsher, the comptroller general. 
"And then they didn't do anything about them." 

   In the savings-and-loan arena, the Reagan administration pressed deregulation -- giving thrifts more freedom than they had ever previously enjoyed -- and cut back on government supervision at the same time. 
Coupled with unsually treacherous swings in interest rates at the beginning of the decade, the result was case after case of bad loans, wild investments, corruption and billions of dollars in losses. 
More banks and thrifts failed during the Reagan years than in any eight-year period since the Depression. 

   Despite loud warnings that the federal insurance fund that guarantees depositors' money wasn't big enough to cover the losses, the administration and Congress procrastinated. 
Legislation passed in 1987 to pump money into the insurance fund proved far too stingy. 
Regulators were overwhelmed. 
Finally, Reagan administration officials simply handed the problem over to their successors. 
Each month's delay added $1 billion to the cost of the final solution. 

   The problem with the nuclear-warhead plants began under President Carter, who in his final days ordered up a faster pace in production. 
"But it was Reagan who really accelerated it," says David Albright, senior staff scientist for the Federation of American Scientists. 
Old weapons plants that had been working eight hours a day, five days a week, went on a seven-day, around-the-clock schedule. 
The Reagan goal was to replace all of the nation's 25,000 warheads and build 17,000 new ones. 

   The rusty old plants couldn't handle the load, and several of them have been closed because of safety concerns. 
Once, says Democratic Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, "many of us believed in the old adage that nuclear weapons provide 'the biggest bang for the buck.' But now we are experiencing 'sticker shock.'" 

   Until last fall, no one seemed to worry very much about the consequences. 
Now it is estimated it will cost $200 billion to modernize the plants and clean up the mess around them.

<TEXT>
   The June 27 editorial "What Doesn't Work" and related page-one story "Lacking Good Results, Corporations Rethink Aid to Public Schools" illustrate the frustration with educational reform. 
There is little correlation among expenditure per pupil, teachers' salaries and the quality of education. 
New York has one of the highest expenditure per pupil and the average teacher salaries are among the highest, yet the high-school graduation rate is below the national average. 
But we should not conclude that we as a nation can afford to spend less on education. 

   The difficulty and complexity of raising educational performance are related to teen-age pathological behavior. 
Many young people are in trouble physically, emotionally and mentally. 
Recent government statistics reveal that close to 25% of all children born in the U.S. are born out of wedlock. 
The traditional family unit is no longer the norm, as teen-age mothers increase on the one hand and divorce rates among couples escalate on the other. 
School performance is clearly undermined by rising juvenile delinquency, increasing drug and alcohol abuse, increasing violent crime, and neglected and abused children. 
We see around us an increase in self-destructive behavior among young men. 
The homicide rate for black teen-agers is a national tragedy. 
Finally, the increase in teen-age suicide has been attributed to the profound changes in the American family. 

   There are no easy panaceas to the educational crisis today. 
Raising teacher salaries to recruit competent and dedicated teachers is necessary but not sufficient to achieve the best educational system in the world. 
We also should examine the content and style of textbooks, the courses that students elect to take and the learning environment in the classroom. 
But even those steps are partial and incomplete. 

   The Coleman report concluded that the primary factor that affected student learning was family background. 
The educational system always has been a reflection of our socioeconomic fabric. 
The evidence suggests that our consensus about the "welfare of society" has fragmented and our social fabric is unraveling.

   Your June 28 editorial "The Battle Over Shoreham" covered the relevant issues regarding this specific situation. 
There are pending electric-supply problems elsewhere in the U.S. due in part to regulatory disarray of a type being experienced in New York. 

   It is difficult for consumers to accept that there is such a supply problem in the U.S. Electricity consumers historically have accepted, as a right, a high level of service from the utility industry. 
We face a different problem today and, it is hoped, this message can be delivered without an electric-supply crisis in some area of the country. 
Possibly Shoreham in Long Island will help deliver the point.

   The Dutch banking concern Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. agreed to buy its third major bank here with a $24 a share, or $420 million, accord for Exchange Bancorp. 

   The agreement would establish the Dutch concern as one of the largest lenders to companies in the Chicago area with annual sales between $1 million and $100 million, the so-called middle market. 

   Banking analysts here said Algemene would also acquire a management group to shore up the lacklaster financial performance of its Chicago unit, LaSalle National Corp., which it bought in 1979. 
Under terms of the accord, John Rau, Exchange president, would become the new president and chief executive officer of the combined Chicago operations, which would have assets of $6 billion. 

   Under Mr. Rau, Exchange became one of the best performing banks in Chicago. 
Its stock price has risen an average 60% annually since 1983, when it traded around $2 a share, said Joan T. Goodman, an analyst at Pershing &amp; Co., Chicago. 
In national over-the-counter trading, Exchange closed at $21.875 a share, up $4.125. 

   The acquisition is subject to a definitive agreement, approval by Exchange shareholders and regulatory approvals. 
A group of Exchange officers and directors, which owns more than 25% of Exchange securities, has made option agreements with the LaSalle unit. 

   A pact might cap a trend among foreign banks to acquire a large foothold in Chicago. 
In September 1984, Bank of Montreal acquired Harris Bankcorp. for $546 million. 
Algemene's LaSalle unit bought a string of suburban Chicago banks last year. 

   Some banking analysts doubt a London or Tokyo bank would make a similar acquisition anytime here soon. 
Among other things, some foreign banks have been shying away from acquiring assets in the U.S. because of unexpectedly high expenses managing them from afar. 
Instead, the trend among foreign banks is to increasingly build alliances with U.S. banks. 

   But the Amsterdam bank's agreement for Exchange, which has $3 billion in assets, seems timed to beat possible suitors that might emerge from big banks in cities such as New York in December 1990, which is when a recently passed state law lowers the barrier to mergers between Illinois banks and banks through the nation. 

   Bank analysts said the offer for Exchange is fair. 
If completed, the deal would reap a windfall for Exchange Chairman Ira J. Kaufman and Mr. Rau, who led a group that took control of Exchange in July 1979 by buying 1.2 million shares of new common stock at about $1.45 each. 

   Exchange officers and directors control more than 45% of its 17.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 

   Mr. Kaufman said he won't continue with Exchange after the proposed acquisition, and would instead concentrate on his brokerage business. 
Mr. Kaufman is chairman and chief executive of Rodman &amp; Renshaw Capital Group Inc., Chicago.

   Your July 12 Managing column mentions that a majority of men and women surveyed by Robert Half would accept slower career progress for more time with family. 
In my opinion, all the talk about a "mommy track" or a "parent track" is really a red flag waving at corporate America, warning it that a growing number of its valued managers refuse to put work above all else. 
This issue is not just for people with families, but for all professional types who realize that maybe they need more balance in their lives. 
As with most things corporate, the change in attitude needs to take hold at the top. 
A 70-hour workweek should not be necessary to succeed. 
It already has been shown that the attitude we bring to work is influenced by the quality of our off-time. 
Why should people have to accept a reduced chance at career opportunities just to spend time with their families?

   CASH-FLOW DISCLOSURE for annual reports stirs debate. 

   A year ago, the Financial Standards Accounting Board started requiring that annual reports break down assets and investments by streams of cash. 
A recent survey says most securities analysts feel the rule helps them but won't help individual investors. 
Patricia McConnell of Bear Stearns says the rule results in "a more level playing field." 
Stuart Sheppard of Ketchum Public Relations says, "Companies are being bought, sold and ripped apart on the basis of cash flow and breakup values." 

   Quaker Oats Co., Chicago, an ardent believer in increasing cash flow, analyzed it in its annual reports before the FASB requirement. 
Rorer Group Inc., Fort Washington, Pa., says the rule doesn't go far enough, noting it doesn't permit stating cash flow on a per-share basis. 
Train Trailer Co., Chicago, says operating cash flow is important but too complex to explain. 
"Very few people would end up understanding it," says Robert Zimmerman, chief financial officer. 

   Financial institutions find gathering cash-flow data costly, so the FASB proposes to ease the disclosures for them. 

   WOODSTOCK MEMORIES are profitable -- for big business anyway. 

   It began as an "Aquarian Exposition." 
It ended as a symbol of the '60s. 
The Woodstock Music and Art Fair in August 1969 left a Bethel, N.Y., farm in a shambles, but Warner Communications may yet clean up. 
The firm, which still co-owns rights to the original event, will re-release two albums and home-video version of the film, but the three-day festival won't be repeated this year. 
"Maybe a 21st anniversary concert," says John Roberts of Woodstock Ventures. 
Seven original acts band together for a "69/89 20th Anniversary Celebration Tour." 

   The Woodstock logo -- a dove perched on a guitar neck -- is selling on T-shirts and mugs, among other things. 
Meanwhile, merchants in Woodstock, N.Y., say business is slow. 
"Either they're all waiting for August or they envision mud and long lines of traffic," says Jean Gaede of the local Chamber of Commerce, adding that no special event is planned. 
"The media is making a lot of hype and scaring our customers away," complains Albert Hoffman, an innkeeper. 

   OFFERING THE BEST PRICE won't by itself win and keep customers. 

   The quality of salesmanship is crucial in buyer-seller relationships, but it often falls short of the buyer's expectations, according to a study by Learning International, Stanford, Conn., a sales and management training firm. 
When asked what caused a buyer to drop a supplier, buyers in the survey indicated the fault often lay with the sales person. 
"The driving issue was breach of partnership," says Edward R. Del Gaizo, who directed the study. 

   The hottest trend in buyer-seller strategies is "partnerships," says Robert J. Bretz, materials-management director at Pitney Bowes Inc. 
The goal: reduce cutthroat bidding based solely on price "and get serious about negotiations that go way beyond price considerations." 
In such partnerships, the buyer gives the supplier more internal data than is typical in the course of a bidding war. 
William A. Bales, a Union Pacific Corp. unit purchasing executive, says, "How suppliers serve you depends on how closely you track their performance." 

   When Union Pacific Railroad started tracking suppliers' on-time performance in 1987, it found 40% of orders arrived late. 
Now it's only 14%, Bales says. 

   BETTOR HALF: Just 5% of all adults account for half the spending on state lotteries, says a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Mass. 
That group wagers about $1,100 each annually. 
Most likely lottery players: males, Hispanics, blacks, the middle-aged, Catholics, laborers and people lacking college degrees. 

   THE DISABLED ACHIEVER is the theme of new ads for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, New York. 
Instead of portraying the disabled as helpless, the ads feature, among others, a quadriplegic marine biologist and a paraplegic model. 

   BAD DEBT in 1989 will cost each U.S. resident $250 in the form of higher consumer-goods prices needed to recover related losses, says the American Collectors Association, Minneapolis. 

   VENTURE-LEASING DEALS proliferate as a way to nurture start-ups. 

   Since 1986, equipment-leasing companies have provided $329 million in financing for new companies that couldn't get bank loans, says Lloyd Mintz of Venture Economics, a Wellesley Hills, Mass., consulting firm. 
A total of $154.9 million was invested in 1988, up 69% from 1987. 
To compensate for the risk of lending to a start-up, leasing companies also take an equity position. 
The total returns: 22% to 24%, some leasing firms say. 

   A lessor typically will take equity in return for leasing such gear as computers or machinery and providing a line of credit. 
"Venture leasing is attractive to young, cash-poor companies because it removes equipment debt from their balance sheets," but the strategy is still "a relatively new, unproven investment vehicle," Mintz says. 

   Geoff Woolley of Dominion Ventures, a San Francisco venture-leasing firm, says the field is destined to be a profitable but small niche business. 

   BRIEFS: The average supermarket loses a steak a day from the meat case, says Knogo Corp., a Hauppauge, N.Y., maker of anti-theft systems. . . . 
Fertil-A-Chron Inc., Deer Park, N.Y., guarantees conception in six months using its computerized fertility indicator or your $145 will be refunded.

   The human body, head to toe,

   It fills the interstitial space 

   That holds each molecule in place; 

   And if we grow a trifle stout, 

   We ripple as we move about. 

   The highest wisdom that we know 

   Is simply going with the flow, 

   For time and tide refuse to wait -- 

   Succumbing, we evaporate, 

   And rising to a higher plane 

   Condense, and fall as acid rain.

   South Korea's current account surplus for the first six months of 1989 fell 58% to $2.4 billion from $5.8 billion in the year-earlier period, Bank of Korea reported. 

   The drop was attributed by the bank to the sharply reduced trade surplus. 
During the first half, exports grew by a mere 6.8% from a year earlier to $29 billion while imports surged 19% to $27 billion. 
As a result, the trade surplus shrank to $2 billion from $4.5 billion.

   Major Japanese trading companies signed contracts to export 1.083 trillion yen ($7.64 billion) of goods in June, up 11.6% from a year earlier, owing in part to strong demand overseas for plants and ships, the Japan Foreign Trade Council said. 

   Meanwhile, import contracts amounted to 1.581 trillion yen, a 20.9% surge from a year earlier. 
The council compiles its monthly report on the basis of contract statistics supplied by 18 major trading houses, which handle about half of the country's overall exports and two-thirds of imports, and their data provide an early indication of short-term trends in trade.

   Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc. said that its board adopted a stock-purchase rights plan intended to deter any hostile takeover attempts but that the move wasn't a response to any effort to acquire the banking company. 

   Cullen/Frost is the last major, independent Texas banking company that hasn't been sold or taken over by regulators. 

   Its rights plan allows holders to buy Cullen/Frost stock at half price if a hostile suitor acquires or makes a tender offer for at least 15% of the shares outstanding, or to buy stock in the surviving company at half price if a person or group acquires more than 50% of the shares or the company is involved in a merger.

   Australia's consumer-price index rose 2.4% during the second quarter and was up 7.6% from a year earlier, the Bureau of Statistics said. 

   The 2.4% rise, which was close to market expectations, followed a 1% gain in the first quarter. 
But that number was made artificially smaller by a change in the method of calculating the index. 

   The 7.6% rise from the 1988 second quarter compares with a rise of 6.8% in the 12 months ended March 31.

   The offer commenced last Friday. 

   The apparel company said Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York is providing $500 million in financing. 

   As of July 18, VF had 68,174,113 common shares outstanding. 

   In a Dutch auction, a company sets a price range within which stockholders can tender their shares. 
The highest price within that range necessary to acquire all the shares the company wants becomes the purchase price for all the shares.

<HL> PepsiCo's Net Income in Second Quarter
@  Rose 21% Due in Part to Special Gains

   PepsiCo Inc. reported a 21% increase in second-quarter net income, aided partly by special gains. 

   Net for the soft-drink, snack-food and restaurant company rose to $264.9 million, or $1 a share, from $219.6 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. 
The latest earnings included a grab bag of extraordinary items, including a credit related to a Japanese bottling operation and charges at the snack food and Kentucky Fried Chicken divisions. 
The net result was a gain of $15 million, or six cents a share. 
Without these items, net income would have risen 14% to 94 cents a share -- about in line with analysts' estimates. 

   Sales of the Purchase, N.Y.-based concern rose 24% to $3.59 billion from $2.9 billion. 

   Pepsi's increase came despite its aggressive acquisition of bottling operations, which was part of an overall industry consolidation and which diluted second-quarter earnings 12 cents a share. 
But "the underlying strength of our ongoing operations and the impressive cash flow they generate enable us to invest for long-term growth and still achieve our annual performance goals," said D. Wayne Calloway, Pepsi chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement. 

   The rate of Pepsi's quarterly profit growth eased considerably from the first quarter's 46% net increase. 
But "given the fact that they're absorbing the dilution {from the bottling acquisitions}, they've done very well," said Martin Romm, an analyst with First Boston Corp. 
"The acquisitions are long-term and strategic, and I think the market understands there is a short-term price to be paid." 

   Pepsi's stock rose $1.50 a share yesterday, to close at $59 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Led by Ruffles, Fritos and Doritos, Frito-Lay's domestic volume rose more than 8% in the quarter, while overall snack-food operating profit rose 24%. 
The strong volume growth helped absorb the costs of promotional spending for new potato chip products and high potato costs, which were driven up partly by the residual effects of last summer's drought. 

   Excluding a one-time credit and the net impact of the purchase and sale of bottling operations, soft-drink operating profits rose 32%. 
Retail pricing for Pepsi's company-owned bottlers rose 2% in the quarter. 
Higher pricing and this year's rainier summer have slowed the soft-drink industry's volume growth to about 3%, from a more typical 4% to 5%. 
Led by Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew, Pepsi's second-quarter domestic case sales rose 3% for the quarter and 4% for the first half of the year. 

   Restaurant earnings rose 15% to $102.1 million in the quarter but were hampered by an $8 million pretax charge to consolidate some domestic Kentucky Fried Chicken operations. 
Taco Bell and Pizza Hut showed strong gains in sales and earnings. 

   But Kentucky Fried Chicken earnings, excluding the charge, fell 19%. 
Pepsi blamed higher costs for chicken and labor and a decrease in restaurant traffic. 
"KFC just isn't on a roll," said Emanuel Goldman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst. 
Among other things, he said, the world's largest fast-food chicken chain needs new products to generate greater sales and more promotional marketing programs similar to those that helped rejuvenate Taco Bell. 

   In the first six months, Pepsi net rose 29% to $430 million, or $1.62 a share, from $332.9 million, or $1.27 a share, a year earlier. 
The latest period includes the net gain of $15 million, while the year-earlier net includes a $10.4 million charge for reorganizing domestic soft-drink operations. 

   Sales rose 22% to $6.55 billion from $5.38 billion.

   Southern Co. said first-half profit jumped 20%, but added that the full year's performance will depend on the outcome of a Georgia rate case. 

   The utility concern said net income rose to $384.4 million, or $1.22 a share, from $318.3 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose to $3.56 billion from $3.46 billion, while kilowatt-hour sales grew 3.7%. 

   Continued growth in energy sales and utilization during the period led to "stronger financial results," said Edward L. Addison, president. 
He added that "the outcome of a rate case now in progress in Georgia will have a significant impact on our earnings for the full year." 

   Public hearings on a $374 million rate-increase request from Southern's Georgia Power unit began last week. 
The increase, which would be phased in over two years, is designed to help it recover costs at the Unit 2 Vogtle Nuclear Power Plant. 

   The Georgia Public Service Commission has already disallowed certain costs related to Unit 1 Vogtle, a decision that Southern has appealed in court. 
Unless the commission's decision is overturned, the company will have to take a $205 million charge, Mr. Addison said. 

   For the most recent 12-month period, Southern said net increased 27% to $912.4 million, or $2.90 a share, from $721.1 million, or $2.36 a share. 
Revenue rose to $7.32 billion from $7.26 billion. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Southern's shares closed at $27.50, up 75 cents.

<DD> 07/27/89 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO>
<TEXT>
   Five screenwriters are credited with the concoction of "Turner &amp; Hooch." 
And this new product from Walt Disney's Touchstone Pictures does indeed look like something to which many hands have given a twist of the wrench on some assembly line. 
Yet, coolly efficient and uninspired though it may be, the picture's pairing of Tom Hanks and a very ugly dog makes for some good laughs and some generally passable entertainment. 

   Mr. Hanks, adept at transferring his amusing screen personality from film to film without making enormous readjustments, is his expectable appealing self. 
But what keeps the contrived enterprise trotting along is a Disney specialty: a dog. 
The pooch in question is particularly winning because he is such a complete loser by any normal doggy criterion. 

   Hooch is a junkyard mutt, whose physique and manner are a canine version of the late John Belushi's Slobovian frat boy in "National Lampoon's Animal House." 
Hooch is nonchalantly flatulent, thrives on chocolate chip cookies and beer, and has a pronounced drool, one of the movie's running gags. 
He looks smelly. 

   The film makers chose Beasley, a De Bordeaux mastiff, to make his debut as Hooch. 
Despite its elegant French pedigree, the De Bordeaux breed, at least this example of it, is not "tres joli." 
Beasley has enough skin to cover two big dogs; the excess flaps in the breeze when he moves. 

   The movie juggles many themes and situations favored by Disney's Touchstone people in many of their successful, disposable comedies. 
Chief among these are hostile partners who become friendly ("Shoot to Kill"); the pairing of a neat partner and a messy one ("Stakeout"); the humanizing of rigid or otherwise undeveloped men by means of more innocent creatures, usually babies or small children ("Three Men and a Baby" and "Three Fugitives"). 

   In this case, the tables are turned. 
The small creature, Hooch, gets civilized by a neat and clean grownup man -- and the man loosens up. 
Turner (Mr. 
Hanks) is a small-city detective in a picture postcard Northern California beach town and a model practitioner of a strict yuppie regimen: He exercises, takes mega-vitamins, dresses with a casual formality, always buckles his seat belt, grinds his own coffee beans and keeps his person and his house in fastidious order. 
Hooch, who becomes his sidekick, fulfills many functions: He is the initially hostile Other, undeniably messy and childlike, in his fashion (that is, unrestrained in his display of emotion, totally infuriating or endearing, depending on his behavior at the moment). 

   Director Roger Spottiswoode, who directed "Shoot to Kill" as well as the far more compelling "Under Fire," is an able journeyman who introduces no surprises but makes no gaffes either as he allows Mr. Hanks and Beasley to go through their paces. 
Chubby Reginald VelJohnson is on hand to do a milder variant on the supporting cop role he played in "Die Hard." 
The earnest, talented actress Mare Winningham brings romance to Mr. Hanks, so no one can question the purity of his relationship with Hooch. (Hooch has his own love object, a toothsome collie bitch.) 

   The only unpredictable and rather inexplicable bit of business in this movie was the creative decision to have Mr. Hanks repeatedly appear wearing only black briefs. 
This is not particularly flattering to him. 
Yet in a movie like this, where nothing is uncalculated, the costume must be making a point, perhaps to illustrate that the pale Turner had too much sense to venture out to the beach without protecting himself with sunblocking lotion. 

   ---

   "UHF," a parody of trash television, is almost defiantly silly, but when it's funny it is very funny. 
The picture has the pace and feel of a segment of "Saturday Night Live" -- lots of filler in between the occasional hilarious spoof. 
Co-author and star "Weird Al" Yankovic has become famous with his parodies of rock stars and their videos, and his original compositions, such as "Stuck in a Closet With Vanna White." 
His videos include his "Like a Surgeon" takeoff on Madonna's "Like a Virgin"; his "Fat" version of Michael Jackson's "Bad." 
Now Mr. Yankovic has decided to expand his particular talents to the wider horizons of film. 
Eccentric as Mr. Yankovic's humor is, he appears onscreen to be cherubic and slightly remote. 
He's assigned himself the part of George Newman, a young man who has failed in many ways, including working at a fast-food restaurant. 
George's Uncle Harvey has won a ramshackle UHF television station in a poker game and hires George to run it. 

   Mr. Yankovic and his co-author Jay Levey, the movie's director, have concocted some truly goofy variations on bottom-of-the-barrel television ads and shows. 
Some are gross and in terrible taste -- and may make you feel ashamed for laughing so hard at them (for example, "Raul's Wild Kingdom," an animal show with a sadistic host who amuses himself by tossing poodles out of upper-story windows). 

   This sloppy, good-natured satire certainly doesn't threaten "Network's" status as the classic decimation of the television business. 
In fact, you may want to wait and catch it on the tube. 
Nothing will be lost in the shrinking. 

   ---

   Video Tip: "Turner &amp; Hooch" reminded me that the dog days of summer are upon us, a good time, perhaps, to remember "Old Yeller." 
When a friend of mine was quite small, her mother took her and some of her little pals to see "Old Yeller" for a birthday celebration. 
When the mother realized what was coming at the end, she told the kids the picture was over and hustled them out of the theater before Old Yeller met his fate. 
Maybe the kiddies would be better off with the cheery "Lady and the Tramp."

   Even though 315 out of 435 House Members are co-sponsoring repeal of Section 89, a series of onerous restrictions on employee fringe benefits, the House leadership still wants to block a floor vote. 
But now the Appropriations Committee has voted to bar Treasury from enforcing Section 89; the proposal now must win a Rules Committee vote today to reach the floor. 
Ten of the 13 committee Members are co-sponsors of the repeal bill, but in May a full third of Members opposed to Section 89 bowed to leadership pressure and voted against a procedural effort to repeal it. 
We'll be watching to see how many Members of the Rules Committee end up putting their votes where their rhetoric is.

   A company controlled by Broken Hill Proprietary Co. of Australia has agreed to pay 323 million New Zealand dollars (US$187.7 million) for New Zealand Steel Ltd., which had been slated for sale to a Chinese concern in an agreement that fell apart last month. 

   Helenus Corp. will pay NZ$225 million to Equiticorp International PLC, a failed investment-banking and finance company now in receivership, for its 80% stake in New Zealand Steel. 
The remaining 20% of the company will be bought for NZ$98 million from Fisher &amp; Paykel Industries, an electrical appliance maker. 

   An agreement to sell New Zealand Steel to China National Metals &amp; Minerals Import &amp; Export Corp. fell through in June, soon after the Tiananmen Square massacre of protesting students in Beijing. 
Chinese officials have refused to say why they cancelled the sale, but denied it was due to political pressure or an inability to raise funds.

<HL> REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
@  Wright's Drapes </HL>
<DD> 07/27/89 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO>
<GV> CONGRESS (CNG) </GV>
<TEXT>
   When former Speaker of the House Jim Wright is sent packing, he really packs. 

   It is traditional for the Speaker to take a few political mementos from his office home with him when he leaves office. 
According to the Baltimore Sun, a moving van pulled up to the Capitol steps last month. 
Mr. Wright's desk was loaded onto the back. 
So was his chair. 
So were other chairs from the office. 
So were the couch, and the breakfront, and a few tables. 
The drapery must have held a few memories for Mr. Wright, for it was hauled off as well. 
These items are not officially Mr. Wright's, mind you. 
They are considered on "long-term loan." 
Nonetheless, the office Thomas Foley inherited was virtually an empty box. 

   It's not yet clear what is happening to Mr. Wright's booty. 
Most of it was sent to Texas Christian University. 
The library there is going to set up a James Wright Jr. Room, where visitors will be able to gaze at the former Speaker's furniture (officials at the library have not yet unpacked all of the crates, and so do not know yet exactly what they have or how they are going to arrange it). 

   This story illustrates the way many Congressmen regard their positions. 
Indeed, Mr. Wright is not the first Congressman to prove that you can take it with you. 

   Former Speakers Tip O'Neill and Carl Albert brought the trappings of their power home as well. 
Twenty of last year's 27 retiring Representatives now have some furniture as souvenirs. 
The most complete was Fernand St Germain, the rogue Banking Committee Chairman who helped create the savings-and-loan mess, and who was found in violation of ethics rules even by the normally lap-dog Ethics Committee. 
He completely cleaned out his quarters when he retired. 
The Rhode Islander who replaced him in Congress, Ron Machtley, was forced to hold initial meetings with everyone standing up, because there were no chairs. 
Regular Members, unlike House Speakers, do have to pay for the furniture they keep, but the price is determined by a depreciated scale set by the General Services Administration. 
One Congressman paid $4.80 each for leather chairs, $23 each for couches and $60 for a mahogany desk. 

   Ideally, a Congressman's power adheres to the office, not to the person who temporarily holds it. 
But a seat in Congress is now a fiefdom. 
Virtually guaranteed that seat for life, allowed to keep political contributions if they were in office before 1980, accustomed to the bowing and scraping of huge staffs, intimidated bureaucrats and favor-pleading lobbyists, many congressmen assume an almost royal arrogance. 
There has been a change of manners on the Hill. 
The egotism verges on: "l'etat, c'est moi." 

   No wonder they confuse public property with their own. 
No wonder Representatives are so comfortable with transparent legal dodges, such as "on long-term loan" or the ridiculously depreciated prices (departing Senators, by the way, have to pay the full replacement cost for their furniture). 
The furniture scam is only a few drops; Congressmen swim in an ocean of perks. 

   Speaker Wright in the end came to epitomize this new congressional arrogance, contemptuous as he was toward common-sense ethical standards, executive power and even the minority members of his own body. 
The furniture at Texas Christian will not be as grand, but as visitors wander through the James Wright Jr. Room, they may recall the folly of Versailles.

   The European Community and Switzerland reached an accord on reciprocal access to insurance markets, with the exception of life insurance, the Swiss government said. 

   The agreement specifies regulatory provisions and establishes a framework for arbitration between Swiss insurers and the EC. 

   The Association of Swiss Insurers said it was "deeply satisfied" with the agreement. 
About 40% of the 63 billion francs ($38.95 billion) in premium income earned by Swiss insurance companies in 1988 came from EC countries. 

   The accord still must be approved by the Swiss legislature and the European Parliament.

   One man pleaded guilty and six others were charged with criminal acts in connection with alleged racially and religiously motivated violence and vandalism by a Dallas "skinhead" group, the Justice Department said. 

   The guilty plea and criminal charges are the result of a continuing federal grand jury investigation of the Confederate Hammerskins, a Dallas organization that prosecutors say committed acts of violence and vandalism against blacks, Hispanics and Jews during the summer and fall of 1988. 
The grand jury investigation is the first such federal probe of a skinhead group. 

   The growth of racially and religiously motivated crime was the subject of a recent Wall Street Journal article. 

   In the Dallas case, Andrew Francis Flowers pleaded guilty to "threatening and intimidating an unidentified black person." 
Six other people were accused of intimidating blacks and vandalizing Jewish-owned properties in the Dallas area. 
Mr. Flowers faces a maximum sentence of one year's imprisonment and a $100,000 fine.

@  A Wall Street Requiem

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO>
<TEXT>
   There may yet be a good book in the destruction of one of Wall Street's great firms, E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. 

   Think of the drama in the firm's last year or so, when a cast of characters ranging from the inept to the greedy and callous took a faltering firm, and with the help of the crash, finished it off. 

   There was the former chairman, Robert Fomon, determined to undermine the remaining Hutton executives who had engineered his ouster in 1987 after years of mismanagement. 
There was his successor, Robert Rittereiser, a hard-working nice guy who reached the CEO's office from humble beginnings as a clerk but had trouble making decisions once he got there. 

   There was the board of directors, headed by Peter Ueberroth, then baseball commissioner, which accepted lucrative severance deals after the fall but that had done little to help save the firm. 

   And there were the victims: Hutton's shareholders, who were denied $50 a share for their Hutton stock in 1986 because the board rejected an initial merger proposal from Shearson Lehman Bros. 
Inc., only to be forced to accept one from Shearson a year later at $29.25 a share. 
Also hurt were some 5,000 Hutton employees, cashiered after the Shearson/Hutton merger. 

   All of this was well documented in newspaper and magazine accounts at the time. 
But they could not provide the kind of behind-the-scenes anecdotes and vivid revelations that can come only from months if not years of painstaking research. 
Unfortunately, both Donna Sammons Carpenter and John Feloni in "The Fall of the House of Hutton" (Holt, 322 pages, $19.95) and Mark Stevens in "Sudden Death: The Rise and Fall of E.F. Hutton" (NAL Books, 298 pages, $19.95) rarely get much beyond the public record on Hutton, and they even manage to waste what others gave them, by letting the intrinsic intensity of the events evaporate in shapeless narration. 

   Subjected to closer scrutiny, Mr. Fomon, who ran Hutton for 17 years, could himself be the subject of an interesting book. 
He built Hutton into a brokerage industry powerhouse, became wealthy in the process and married a former Miss America. 
By the early 1980s, however, Mr. Fomon's personal and professional lives were in decline. 
Divorced, lonely and drinking more heavily, Mr. Fomon became increasingly removed from Hutton's day-to-day operations and began making embarrassing public statements. 
He and Hutton suffered a grave humiliation when the firm pleaded guilty in 1985 to 2,000 counts of federal mail and wire fraud in the now infamous check-kiting scandal. 
Thereafter, Mr. Fomon's power slowly slipped away to his newly hired No. 2, Mr. Rittereiser, whose new management team exacerbated the firm's collapse. 

   Ms. Carpenter and Mr. Feloni, unwilling or unable to move smoothly through the history they have undertaken to relate, have broken their book up into a hiccuping series of assertedly significant days culled from Hutton's last seven years. 
Unfortunately, many of these days were not, as Edward R. Murrow used to say, "filled with the events that alter and illumine our times." 
Under the heading Monday, July 24, 1984, we are told the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its low for the year but aren't told why that mattered. 
In fact, it is a factoid, irrelevant to the Hutton story. 

   Mr. Stevens has a surer hand with a sentence, but he has a weakness for lazy quips: Mr. Rittereiser, for example, is described at one point as a "Santa Claus in a business suit." 
He also at times turns his narrative over to single sources who are quoted at length. 
A longtime Hutton investment banker, Paul Bagley, is permitted to provide without rebuttal a largely negative critique of Mr. Rittereiser's management team. 

   By mid-1986, all the players in this disturbing tale are on stage. 
Hutton's overpaid and by now underperforming sales staff is in open revolt because of the lack of leadership at headquarters. 
Mr. Fomon and Mr. Rittereiser are at war with each other. 
New legal and business problems crop up monthly. 
Perhaps Mr. Rittereiser's most dubious hire in the eyes of many Hutton colleagues, marketing chief Jerry Welsh, tries at one point to illustrate Hutton's problems with a coloring book distributed to all Hutton managers that contained such silly phrases as: "If we don't fix our problems soon, someone could even take our home away." 

   It's unclear just how long this show would have run on its own, but the October 1987 crash pulled the curtain down quickly. 
As the firm was being sold, many of those whose performance through the firm's time of crisis was altogether undistinguished were taken care of nicely. 
Mr. Fomon had already secured a $3 million severance deal, and Mr. Rittereiser was awarded $1.2 million. 
In an even more surprising action, the members of the Hutton board accepted $2.2 million in severance benefits. 
Mr. Ueberroth, already a multimillionare, got $420,000 plus an additional $500,000 for the work he did negotiating the Shearson merger; Dina Merrill, a successful actress and heir, as daughter, to E.F. Hutton himself, got $307,500. 

   Many Hutton employees got something from the merger too: a pink slip. 
Some of them were herded into a conference room, told to clear out their belongings quickly and were then searched on their way out the door. 
Wouldn't it have been terrible if the hired help had walked away from Hutton with anything they didn't deserve?

@  Sellars Does Mozart, Dark and Depraved

<TEXT>
   After 10 years of impressive avantgarde events in theater and music, the PepsiCo Summerfare festival is going out with a bang. 
Audiences in this very pleasant venue just north of Manhattan are getting a complete look at the three Mozart-Da Ponte operas that Peter Sellars created one by one in past seasons. 
And they will hear Roger Norrington's two-day "Beethoven Experience" exploring the Ninth Symphony. 
You couldn't have more disparate bookends than these two visions of some of the most revered totems of the literature. 

   Mr. Norrington's work, with original instruments, is all about the rediscovery of period context for Beethoven. 
Mr. Sellars, on the other hand, has run headlong in the other direction, presenting what amounts to a complete and ahistorical deconstruction of the Mozart operas. 
Mr. Sellars's productions cannot be considered merely interpretations or updatings of "Le Nozze di Figaro," "Don Giovanni" and "Cosi Fan Tutte." 
They are radical rethinkings of what these operas are about. 
The texts, sung here in the original Italian, are treated as poetic obbligatos rather than the dramatic frameworks that Lorenzo Da Ponte gave Mozart. 
Instead we have Mr. Sellars's own elaborate plot synopses in the program book, which delve into psychological motivations that sometimes diverge markedly from any traditional understanding of the librettos. 
Clearly, Mr. Sellars hears something quite different in the music, which is his privilege. 
Whether he can persuade us that what he hears is there is another matter altogether. 

   The most sensational example is "Don Giovanni," an opera hard to make sense of at the best of times. 
Mr. Sellars claims that it is about addiction, and creates an entirely new environment for it: a Spanish Harlem underworld of gangs, drugs and violence. 
Don Giovanni is a corrupt kingpin/rapist on his way out and balked at every turn by Anna, Ottavio, Elvira, Zerlina, Masetto, Leporello and finally, the Commendatore. 
None of his tormenters is innocent, however: Even Donna Anna is a drug addict, who shoots up midway through "Non mi dir." 

   In the original PepsiCo staging two years ago, the Don's declining state was graphic; he was made to fade into the background, leaving, essentially, an opera without its central character. 
Mr. Sellars's redirection of the production this year features a somewhat more assertive Giovanni in Eugene Perry. 
He has also introduced a confusion: Mr. Perry's twin brother, Herbert, sings Leporello, and the two are so physically and vocally alike that its hard to know who's the boss. 
Maybe that's the point. 
But so what? 
The twin casting is only one example of the murkiness of this show. 

   The darkness of Mr. Sellars's world is unrelieved. 
Long stretches of the opera are played in almost total blackness, a directorial conceit that has the audience working hard to figure out what's going on. 
Even more troubling is the premise it expresses: there is no possibility of redemption in this "Giovanni." 

   The Don's descent into hell is one of the production's better moments. 
The set cracks apart, and Giovanni is sucked into a manhole. 
But the final sextet has the characters stuck in their own hell as they peer out, naked, from fiery trap doors in the floor. 
Indeed, the unrelenting pessimism of Mr. Sellars's point of view effectively prevents emotional involvement on the part of the audience. 
How can you care about these people? 
They're all awful, and not even pitiable. 

   Mr. Sellars's "Cosi" is just as cruel. 
This sharp but ultimately tender comedy of human foibles has been transformed into a vicious, bludgeoning account of interpersonal sadism. 
The cartoony Act I, set in Despina's diner by the sea, is staged with mirror moves for the two couples and a lot of silly television-reference stage business (Despina waves a roll of paper towels, Bounty-style, at one point) to show the superficiality of the four lovers, and the malice and frustration of Alfonso and Despina. 

   In Act II, we are plunged into literal and figurative darkness again, and Mr. Sellars makes an especially radical break from Da Ponte: He postulates that the girls know about the trick that's being played on them and are getting even. 
No self-knowledge or forgiveness is possible under such circumstances; the working-out of the joke is just ugly and unresolvable. 

   Mr. Sellars takes less license with "Figaro," probably because it has fewer inherent ambiguities to exploit. 
He sets the action in a luxurious Trump Tower duplex, with Figaro and Susanna, chauffeur and maid, installed in the laundry room with a fold-out couch that occupies most of the space. 
Mr. Sellars reduces the opera to a parable about sexual jealousy and desire, but some of his scenes are right on the mark. 
The convergence of Cherubino, the Count and Basilio in Susanna's room in Act I, for example, is high comedy. 
Even more titillating is the spectacle of the Countess and Susanna undressing Cherubino and dressing him in the Countess's clothes in Act II: two adult women teasing an overheated adolescent. 

   But in Act III, Mr. Sellars takes the conceit too far. 
He has the Countess practically making out with Cherubino during the flower presentation scene. 
The Countess loses her dignity, and we lose the Countess. 
Cherubino, too, has lost his charm. 
Why would any woman want this gawky teen-ager toting a hockey stick and skates and accompanying "Non so piu" with pelvic thrusts? 

   This is typically excessive Sellars Mozart. 
In exploring the subconscious underpinnings of these scores, he reduces their message to evil, violence and depravity. 
In all three productions, characters are constantly throwing things (often food), slamming doors, beating each other, threatening each other with weapons (the Count pulls a pistol on the Countess in Act II of "Figaro"). 
The result is a depressing tearing apart of an 18th-century world in which manners counted and the unexpressed undercurrents were more powerful for being left that way. 
The sophomoric reliance on food fights leads one to suspect a directorial failure of invention, of which there are plenty of other examples, in addition to the frequent, alienating darkness. 
Why do the quick finales have to be staged as conga lines and cha-chas? 
Why do characters frequently lie down on the floor in the same elegant Mark Morris-style movement? 
And why do the arias usually go flat as theater, while the ensemble scenes are imbued with energy? 

   How do the singers justify all this? 
Clearly they are at one with the concepts. 
They navigate the music and complex staging with varying degrees of vocal beauty but they perform the Sellars business, complex as it is, with absolute precision. 

   Many of the singers work regularly with Mr. Sellars, and the best ones are impressive. 
The "Figaro" cast was the strongest, with Sanford Sylvan (Figaro), Jeanne Ommerle (Susanna), Jayne West (the Countess) and James Maddalena (the Count). 

   In the pit, Craig Smith took the same sorts of liberties with accents and tempi that Mr. Sellars took with the staging, though oddly enough he often smoothed out passages where an edge probably would have underscored the director's message better. 
The fact that audiences responded so positively to these productions is troubling. 
Perhaps people are so bored by standard productions of these familiar operas that any deviation, however perverse, is welcome, especially when it is so skillfully done. 
Perhaps the updating makes them seem more immediate, and the slickness of execution turns them into a kind of high class MTV, where the language barrier doesn't matter. 
But Mr. Sellars did not persuade me that Mozart is all about darkness and depravity, and the emotional barrenness of his productions is chilling. 
Opera has to be something more than an intellectual exercise. 
These particular pieces are humanist works about redemption, forgiveness and light as well as anger and despair. 
That is what makes them great.

@  Plan 27.9% Rise
@  In Capital Outlays

   Canadian manufacturers, encouraged by the new U.S.-Canada free-trade pact, intend to boost their spending on plant and equipment by 27.9% this year, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said. 

   The new projection is up from a March forecast of a 20.7% rise in 1989 capital outlays. 
Last year, capital spending by manufacturers increased 14.9%. 

   The latest spending estimates show that Canadian business is "responding to the realities of the free-trade agreement," said Mike McCracken, president of Informetrica Ltd., an economic-consulting firm. 

   The trade pact, which took effect Jan. 1, provides for gradual elimination of most trade barriers between the U.S. and Canada, including a phase-out of all tariffs by January 1998. 

   Roger Hamel, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said the prospect of the free-trade agreement was a "significant" factor in business planning for this year's capital spending. 

   Among manufacturers, producers of paper products, primary metals and chemicals are expected to show the biggest increase in 1989 outlays. 

   Other business sectors, except for the mining industry, also intend to increase capital outlays this year. 
Capital spending by the mining sector is expected to drop 11.6%, mainly because of an anticipated 15.1% drop in outlays by the oil industry. 

   Economists said Canadian capital outlays would have risen this year even without the free-trade agreement, but probably not as strongly. 
Some industries have been operating at close to capacity; these include primary metals, electrical and electronic products, primary textiles, and chemicals. 
Manufacturers generally have been operating at about 84% of capacity. 

   Another factor cited in the big planned increase in capital spending was the desire of business to take advantage of the tax system's accelerated write-off rates for manufacturing investments. 
These rates are to be reduced further in 1990 and 1991. 

   Capital-spending intentions have strengthened, despite Canada's high interest rates. 
Prime lending rates of Canadian banks have been at 13.5% since March, the highest level in five years. 

   Manufacturing, however, has held up fairly well. 
New orders rose 2% in May, partly offsetting a 4.6% decline in April, Statistics Canada said. 
Shipments rose 0.5% in May. 
The ratio of inventories to shipments was 1.55 to 1 in May, unchanged from April and up slightly from 1.54 to 1 a year earlier. 

   John Clinkard, senior economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said he doesn't expect any further capital-spending growth next year, because of what he predicts will be an erosion of corporate profits and a decline in capacity-utilization rates as the economy softens. 

   Capital spending by manufacturers is expected to rise to 22.53 billion Canadian dollars (US$18.97 billion) this year from C$17.62 billion last year, Statistics Canada said.

   The average seven-day compounded yield on the 381 taxable money-market mutual funds tracked by Donoghue's Money Fund Report slipped to 8.97% in the week ended Tuesday. 

   While that's slightly under the previous week's 9.03%, the move below 9% is apt to be at least psychologically important to many investors who had grown accustomed to double-digit yields just a few weeks ago. 

   Investors looking for higher rates elsewhere are almost certain to be disappointed. 
For example, the average six-month certificate of deposit is paying just 8.12%, according to Banxquote Money Markets. 
The average bank money-market account currently pays only 7.11%. 

   Susan Cook, editor of Donoghue's, a newsletter, says the latest drop in money-fund yields "was basically expected with the direction of all short-term interest rates." 

   Yields on money funds have been falling at a slower pace than those on some competing instruments partly because fund managers have been stuffing their portfolios with issues that have increasingly longer maturities. 
By extending the life of their portfolios in this way, they have managed to lock in the higher rates of previous weeks for some time into the future. 

   The average money fund maturity dipped a bit in the week ended Tuesday to 41 days, from 42, according to Donoghue's. 
But, "that should not be misconstrued as a change in money fund manager's sentiment," said Ms. Cook. 
She said fund managers determined that their lengthening the previous week was overzealous in the wake of announcements by the Federal Reserve. 
The Fed indicated interest rates would fall only gradually. 
Last week the maturity jumped to 42 from 40 days. 

   Reflecting the higher yields available to fund managers on investments like Treasury bills and commercial paper just weeks ago, the average 30-day compounded yield remained above 9% in the latest week. 
It slipped to 9.11%, from 9.18%, according to Donoghue's. 

   The money-fund asset level, which grew again this week, reflects investor inability to find comparable returns. 
Assets of the funds measured by Donoghue's grew $2.3 billion to $324 billion. 
Compound yields assume the reinvestment of dividends and that rates remain unchanged for a year. 
Without taking into account the effects of compounding, the average seven-day yield fell to 8.60%, from 8.66%; the 30-day yield dropped to 8.73% from 8.79%.

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., building on its fledgling snack food business, said it agreed to buy the Fisher Nut unit of Beatrice/Hunt-Wesson Inc. 

   Terms weren't disclosed, but it is understood the purchase price would approach $150 million. 

   The sale is subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission. 
The agency required Beatrice's owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., to sell certain businesses as part of an agreement allowing it to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. last fall. 
RJR Nabisco owns Planters, the leading brand with 50% of the salted-nut business. 

   The Cincinnati consumer products concern quietly had expressed interest in buying Planters, but settled for No. 2 Fisher, which has an estimated 11% of the salted-nut market. 

   The proposed purchase met with mixed reaction from analysts, largely because P&amp;G has a spotty record in the food business. 
"Once again, they're the David going after Goliath," said Lynne Hyman, analyst with First Boston Corp. 

   In potato chips, for instance, P&amp;G's Pringle's brand trails Frito-Lay's chips, while its Citrus Hill orange juice lags in third place behind Tropicana and Minute Maid. 

   But the purchase would offer some synergies for P&amp;G, which already buys peanuts for its Jif peanut butter. 
The Fisher unit, which has a variety of peanuts, cashews and other nuts, has annual sales of about $100 million, analysts said. 

   P&amp;G is expected to bolster the Fisher brand by increasing distribution of the products. 
Only half of the U.S. retail outlets now carry the Fisher line, analysts said. 

   P&amp;G's snack food business could also benefit should its fat substitute, olestra, get Food and Drug Administration approval. 
In a recent interview, John G. Smale, chairman and chief executive officer of P&amp;G, said he considered the fat substitute category to be a "multibillion-dollar market." 

   Mr. Smale wouldn't predict when the FDA will rule on P&amp;G's petition for approval of olestra, but he said P&amp;G scientists have "almost total confidence that approval will come." 
He added: "They are less willing to predict when it's going to come."

<HL> In the War on Drugs, Keep the Troops in the Barracks

   America is in real danger of turning its metaphorical "war on drugs" into a bloody reality. 
With the failure of every other enforcement effort, from crop eradication through border interdiction to street-level policing, a growing chorus of influential Washington policy makers is urging the ultimate escalation -- sending U.S. troops to Latin America to battle traffickers. 

   The calls for military intervention are coming fast and furiously from Congress, where frustrated members from all points on the ideological spectrum share a conviction that only armed force will rid America of drugs. 
"We should engage in joint military and paramilitary operations, with congressional approval, including helicopter and air strikes on cocaine fields," Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.) told a Tufts University audience this year. 
Defending a similar proposal, Rep. Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House narcotics committee, said, "I have a deeper commitment to fighting the drug traffickers than I did the North Koreans." 
Sen. William Cohen (R., Me.) has argued that the only solution is to "go to the source," even if that means "taking out the machine-gun nest" with troops. 

   Key officials in the Bush administration favor a similar approach. 
Drug czar William Bennett privately advocates the use of special operations forces to hit foreign drug labs and shipment centers. 
A National Security Council task force reportedly will recommend to President Bush that he greatly step up the military's role in fighting drugs overseas, including a possible combat role. 
Mr. Bush will be receptive: He told the Veterans of Foreign Wars in March that drugs represent "a threat no less real than the adversaries you have battled" and vowed to "combat drug abuse with . . . our nation's armed forces." 

   The major source of bureaucratic resistance to this groundswell is the Pentagon itself, which doubts whether the drug war is winnable and fears becoming embroiled in an endless, ill-defined commitment that detracts from its traditional mission. 

   The military has good reason to resist this call to arms. 
Given how many countries produce drugs, including the U.S. itself, the chances of winning are small compared to the likelihood of tearing apart the social and political fabric of countries in which the military intervenes. 

   The first problem for U.S. anti-drug expeditionary forces will be defining the enemy. 
Simply shooting a few known kingpins in Medellin won't dry up the supply of either drugs or criminal entrepreneurs willing to run them across borders. 
Peasant growers and traffickers don't wear uniforms. 
Nor do they belong to a single, defined organization that can be forced to surrender. 
"There is a perfect textbook example of guerrilla warfare," Michael Perez, a Drug Enforcement Agency agent stationed in Bolivia, was quoted as saying earlier this year. 
"You never know who's who -- who's a good guy and who's a bad guy." 

   U.S. troops would have to treat entire sectors of Latin American society as potential foes. 
More than half a million Bolivians live off the profits of coca and cocaine production. 
Tens of thousands of peasant cultivators are tightly organized into militant unions with powerful links to national worker organizations. 
Their roadblocks, mass demonstrations, strikes and other nonviolent tactics have paralyzed government efforts to eradicate coca planting. 
Trying to conquer them with force would be no easy feat. 

   It would be all the harder since U.S. troops wouldn't know who their friends are, either. 
Corruption is so endemic in the drug-supplier nations that anyone up to presidents and army chiefs of staff can be on the traffickers' payroll. 
In Colombia, according to a recent Bogota television news report, traffickers appear to "have access to practically all confidential government information, such as minutes of cabinet meetings." 
The corruption ensures that the kingpins enjoy protection even as they use the local police and military to knock off upstart competitors. 

   Colombia, at least, has never been taken over entirely by the traffickers. 
Bolivia was in 1980, during the famous "cocaine coup." 
The situation is not much better now that the corrupt generals and colonels no longer rule. 
Said a former American adviser to the country's narcotics police to an Atlantic Monthly writer, "I have to tell you I think that 100% of the Bolivian enforcement structure was corrupted." 
After the U.S. sent troops to Bolivia in 1986 -- the model for current interventionist proposals -- a Bolivian congressional investigation accused the interior minister who oversaw the whole operation of taking payoffs to protect the major drug lords. 

   Peru is no better. 
A recent staff report by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs observes that "corruption in all segments of the Peruvian government continues to impede meaningful anti-narcotics efforts." 

   Even honest segments of these societies loudly protest the introduction of U.S. forces in the drug war. 
The Latin allergy to anything smacking of "Yankee imperialism" ties the hands of even the most sympathetic leaders. 
The one exception to that rule -- the 1986 U.S. anti-drug raid in Bolivia -- damaged the otherwise-high popularity of President Victor Paz Estensoro's government. 
Today, Bolivian leaders state emphatically they will never permit such an operation again. 

   Latin leaders know that escalating the drug war risks not only their political future, but their nation's survival. 
In Peru, the army frankly confesses the reasons for its reluctance to take on the traffickers at the same time as it fights the fanatical Shining Path guerrillas. 
It needs popular support to fight terrorism -- and it can't retain popular support if it tries to eradicate coca. 

   Unlike traditional counter-insurgency, which relies on winning the loyalty of peasants and isolating radical guerrilla forces, a military campaign against the peasant economy in the Andean states could unite the entire rural population against the intruders. 
"It would create another Vietnam or another Central America," says Edmundo Morales, author of "Cocaine: The White Gold Rush in Peru." 
Already, adds Peruvian journalist Gustavo Gorriti, "the Shining Path guerrillas have been able to maneuver both the Peruvian government and the Americans into doing exactly what they wanted. 
They have made the fight against eradication and punitive raids from police and helicopter-borne units piloted by Americans the cause to unite most of {the peasants}. 
Any kind of escalation of the current commitment will play nicely into their hands." 

   The Shining Path, although not yet successful at penetrating Bolivia, maintains strongholds on the border between the two nations. 
Its proximity may fuel concerns of the Bolivian government, expressed in a 1986 study, that the response of traffickers to military attack might result in "the emergence of a new and deadly guerrilla movement joining extremists, destitute peasants and drug traffickers." 

   Some proponents of military intervention ignore this danger by assuming traffickers, guerrilla insurgents and terrorists are one and the same -- "narco-guerrillas" or "narco-terrorists" -- despite their vastly different social and political agendas. 
Groups like the Shining Path derive some income from drug taxes but ultimately aim to impose a puritanical communist regime; most traffickers have no problem with democracy or capitalism as long as they are left alone. 
In Colombia as well as Peru, traffickers and guerrillas have waged bloody vendettas for control of territory. 
Yet, a foreign invasion that targets them both is likely to bring them together. 

   As long as U.S. demand for drugs swamps Latin American societies with narco-dollars, military intervention will succeed no better than any of the other failed strategies that have attempted to eliminate the supply at its source. 
Unlike them, however, it will risk substantial numbers of American lives abroad on an open-ended, exceedingly dangerous mission. 
Worse, it promises to inflame urban nationalism and peasant radicalism, social forces that together could destroy the fragile governments of any cooperating countries. 
So far no South American country has volunteered to commit suicide for the sake of the U.S.'s frustrated drug warriors. 
North Americans should be glad they haven't.

   Greg LeMond doesn't know what he's missing. 

   Sure, America's ace bicyclist won the Tour de France on Sunday and got to pedal along the Champs Elysees as thousands cheered. 
But he's never had an Iowan in a tuxedo serve him champagne sherbet and Belgian waffles for breakfast, has he? 

   That treat, as it were, is reserved for 300 ticket-buying bike riders converging on the small but cultured town of Randall, Iowa, beginning at 5 this morning. 

   For $6 a head, partakers will dine alfresco in the town park to the sounds of a 1916 Steinway &amp; Sons grand piano. 
Free valet bike parking will be provided. 

   The affair celebrates the passing by of the unofficial Tour de Iowa, a cross-state bike ride sponsored by the Des Moines Register. 
The Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, or Ragbrai as it's called, attracts thousands and is in its 17th year -- but has never before come through Randall. 

   Behind the breakfast spectacle is a group that bills itself as the smallest arts council in America. 
"When we found out they were coming through, we knew we had to do something special to make them stop," says Ellis Anderson, a Randall resident, clothing-store operator, singing teacher and arts-council member. 
The council opted for breakfast since one campsite for the week-long ride is about four miles away. 

   But nothing is simple, not even in a town of 170. 
"We wanted to serve champagne, but the town found out we couldn't get a liquor license for insurance reasons. 
So we made {champagne} sherbet. 
That's food, not liquor," says Robert McNutt, the local piano tuner and arts-council impresario. 
Mr. McNutt, who is providing the piano for the breakfast, established the arts group after migrating to Randall two years ago from Minneapolis with his piano-tuning partner Joel Yushta. 

   Not surprisingly, piano recitals are a mainstay at Randall Arts Council fetes. 
A 12-handed rendition (using three pianos and six pianists) of "Stars and Stripes Forever" two years ago has already passed into local legend, Mr. McNutt boasts. 

   He isn't worried that bicyclists who get a kick from champagne, sherbet or no, may prove a traffic hazard. 
With each breakfast, he says, "we're offering a choice of Gatorade, water or coffee."

@  Shamir, Sharon, What's the Difference?

   "All politicians have to have an active Devil on the string," my father once wrote. 
Israel's Shamir keeps two. 
On one side the PLO, on the other Ariel Sharon; he calls them up as required to bolster his own support, extract some concession from opponents or merely pursue his usual business without serious contradiction. 

   Now and for the past month the devil being jerked hardest at the end of its string is Ariel Sharon, bloody-handed general and aspirant to Israel's Defense Ministry. 
On July 5, Mr. Sharon and two cronies in Likud pressured Mr. Shamir to announce pre-conditions for his elections plan: no participation by the Arabs of East Jerusalem, no negotiations until the intifada was suppressed, no halt to Jewish settlement on the West Bank, no concession of territory and no possibility of agreeing to a Palestinian state -- i.e., no change in the present situation at all and no reason for any Palestinian to go along with it. 
Barely had Mr. Shamir endorsed these conditions at the Likud Party conference than a chorus arose bewailing the bind Mr. Sharon had put him in. 

   This is an essential stage in the effective deployment of the devil. 
People who might otherwise be critical or at least cautious rally round, realizing that any wavering in a life and death struggle with sin will give aid and comfort to the Evil One. 
Israel's Labor Party embraced the original elections proposal, saying that unless it was reaffirmed "without conditions" the coalition government in which it is partner with Likud would fall. 
Secretary of State James Baker reiterated the Bush administration's absolute commitment to the plan. 

   The U.S. corporate press, always bowed in reverence to the official Israeli line, voiced its deepest concern over the "crisis" in Israel with impressive unanimity. 
On July 6 the headline in The Wall Street Journal read "Shamir Puts Israel Coalition at Risk to Appease Hard-Liners." 
The New York Times wrote "Shamir Accepts Hard-Line Moves That Imperil Arab Elections Plan." 

   For weeks the press carried on like this, until the other day when the Israeli cabinet voted almost as one to endorse its original election plan and everyone breathed a sigh of relief that indeed Good had triumphed over Evil. 
"It seems likely," wrote the New York Times's Joel Brinkley, "that Mr. Shamir, as an individual, will negotiate with the Likud conditions in mind while at the same time arguing that the Government as a whole is not bound by them. 
It is just the sort of careful balancing act Mr. Shamir has mastered in the years he has been caught between right-wing political rivals in his own party and left-wing coalition partners -- all of whom have the power to bring down the Government." 

   Mr. Shamir's journey from being a leader of the Stern terrorist gang that in 1941 proposed a treaty with the Nazis and later murdered Lord Moyne and Count Bernadotte to racist provocateur and hardline politician and now to "centrist" is a case study in the manufacture of political acceptability. 
The remarkable thing is that the press continues to adjust the picture while Mr. Shamir himself straight-forwardly displays the despicable views he has always maintained. 
At the time that Mr. Shamir embraced Mr. Sharon's conditions Mr. Brinkley and his fellow U.S. correspondents in Jerusalem reported that he had said, "What is new in this? 
We've said all these things before." 
And indeed when Mr. Shamir first suggested elections back in April, he also pledged to cede "not an inch of territory." 

   But what does the original election plan actually say? 
While proposing negotiations for Palestinian autonomy followed by further talks to "determine the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip," it is also loaded with conditions. 
The third of its 20 points lays down "basic guidelines": "Israel opposes the creation of an additional Palestinian state in the Gaza district and in the area between Israel and Jordan. 
Israel will not negotiate with the PLO. 
There will be no change in the status of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district, unless in accord with the basic program of the government." 

   The question of Jewish settlement, the vote for East Jerusalem and the explicit suppression of the intifada are left in the hazy realm of "details" to be worked out at some undetermined later time, but the premises are clear. 
As Yehoshafat Harkabi, former chief of Israeli military intelligence, wrote in the Los Angeles Times for July 13, "The difference between Shamir and Sharon is only one of style and tactics, not of substance." 

   So what can be expected now that Labor has legitimized as reasonable the utterly unreasonable, and the Bush administration and virtually the whole of mainstream journalistic opinion are proffering variations on the Anti-Defamation League's line that "Israel's willingness to allow all options to be put on the table . . . demonstrates a real readiness to take risks for peace"? 

   Devil Sharon has served his purpose, but a presentiment of what lies ahead came just as the string on which he played had begun to go slack. 
On July 17, Mr. Sharon declared that Israel must "eliminate the heads of the terrorist organizations, first of all Arafat." 
The next day's New York Post had a vast headline "Arafat Must Die]" Other, "serious" papers ran tactful boxes or short items reporting his recommendation. 

   The New York Times, however, inserted Mr. Sharon's death threat in the third paragraph of a story by Mr. Brinkley titled "Israel Asserts Threats by P.L.O. Imperil Bid to Revive Peace Plan." 
The story began: "Even as Israel tries to revive its initiative for Palestinian elections, the Foreign Ministry asserted today that the plan is likely to fail in any case because Palestinians are threatening to kill any Arab who dares to discuss the idea with Israeli officials." 
The string is released; the hand readies to jerk forth its second, more familiar, demon. 
How long will it be before the chorus that rose to defend the "moderate" Shamir, the "courageous" Shamir, against the bully Sharon joins to condemn the PLO for "intrasigence" and finally "rejectionism"? 
Already Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and other spokesmen for Mr. Shamir are increasing pressure on the U.S. to break off its talks with the PLO. 

   In this country, Sens. 
George Mitchell (D., Maine) and Bob Dole (R., Kan.) have engineered the passage of legislation prohibiting the U.S. from talking further with Abu Iyad or any other Palestinian whom the president may document as having participated in attacks upon American citizens. 
Last week The Wall Street Journal carried an essay by Irving Kristol saying "It is perhaps just as well . . . that there is no possibility of a negotiated Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement," and broaching the idea that Israel should decide which slice of the West Bank it would like, annex that territory but leave the rest, and then "cope with West Bank turmoil as it copes with the turmoil in Lebanon." 
Mr. Sharon might then be given another chance to deflect attention from the casual killing committed every day by Mr. Shamir and his fellows.

@  Japan's Sinking Unions
@  ----
@  By Lindley H. Clark Jr. </HL>
<DD> 07/27/89 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO>
<CO> JAPAN LABOR </CO>
<TEXT>
   As the Japanese economy has boomed since World War II, one of its assets has been super-smooth labor relations. 
Workers toiled long hours, expecting -- and getting -- only modest pay increases. 
Labor unions existed and weren't totally ineffectual, but by and large they cooperated with management. 

   The times are changing. 

   Japanese labor leaders say workers simply aren't interested in working as hard as their fathers and mothers did. 
There is a growing feeling among workers that they aren't getting a fair share in the nation's prosperity. 

   You might think this would make the workers fair game for union organizers, but it isn't so. 
Since 1975, the unions' share of the work force has fallen from 35% to 28%. 
Among the major industrial economies, only the U.S. is de-unionizing faster: the portion of the U.S. work force in unions has fallen from 25% to 15% over the same period. 

   A pair of National Bureau of Economic Research studies indicates that reasons for the union decline in the two countries are similar. 
Richard B. Freeman and Marcus E. Rebick consider Japan (Working Paper No. 2963), while Henry S. Farber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology looks at the U.S. (Working Paper No. 2857). 

   In both countries a prime factor seems to be that workers no longer believe that unions will solve any problems the workers may have. 
In both nations, too, one reason for the unions' perceived ineffectiveness is stronger resistance from management. 
Both studies say, moreover, that management resistance has grown in an administrative and legal atmosphere considered to be supportive of management. 

   It's not altogether surprising that the union experience in the two countries has been similar. 
Unions, after all, were more or less an American gift to Japan. 
After World War II, the American occupation forces seemed determined to Americanize Japan, and unions may have been a predictable part of the process. 

   With U.S. encouragement, the Japanese constitution was amended to guarantee workers "the right to organize and to bargain and act collectively." 
The idea caught on, and the early growth of unions was smooth. 
There were special Japanese touches. 
Nearly all of the unionized workers were in "enterprise" unions, which represented the work force of a single company. 
One of the main features of such unions was "lifetime" employment. 
It didn't really mean lifetime; workers were expected to leave at age 55. 
But employers didn't lay off workers, either permanently or temporarily, and workers were expected to stay with the company, even if another firm offered fatter paychecks. 

   All went well for years. 
The booming Japanese economy provided jobs for just about everyone who wanted one. 
Unions didn't have much to do with it, although they may have taken credit for it. 

   The turning point was the big oil price increase initiated by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the early 1970s. 
Japan, totally dependent on imported oil, faced huge increases in energy costs. 
At the same time, Japan was running into growing competition from low-cost producers such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore. 
There was a growing world surplus of output capacity in industries that had been important to Japanese growth, such as steel. 
Even U.S. manufacturers were modernizing and becoming more competitive. 
In mid-1985 the yen began a steep rise that made Japanese exports less competitive. 

   Labor relations became less pleasant. 
The oil price increase triggered a burst of inflation, and companies granted big pay boosts. 
But workers felt the boosts were insufficient. 
The "spring offensives," during which unions and management settled pay increases, became more combative. 

   With profits under pressure, it was hardly surprising that management became more aggressive in resisting unions. 
The legal environment changed in ways that made it more difficult for unions to organize new companies. 
Court decisions held that some union actions on the employer's premises or during working hours violated employer property rights. 

   In part because of management opposition, workers began to show less interest in unions. 
The Japanese unemployment rate, which had been almost invisible, began creeping up, and "lifetime" employment began to mean even less. 
Manufacturers began shifting production to Taiwan, Korea, even the U.S. Apparently some workers felt this was no time to make waves by plunging into union organizing. 

   A major handicap for the Japanese unions has been the enterprise setup: one company, one union. 
This made it difficult to launch organizing drives at new, nonunion companies. 
To deal with this problem, Japanese unions have stepped up merger efforts but the outcome is uncertain. 

   Another handicap for Japanese unions has been their long (and mutual) dislike for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. 
Last Sunday's smashing LDP defeat may eventually lead to political benefits for the unions, but it's too early to tell. 
Before the election, one government survey indicated that the union share of the work force would fall to 14% by the year 2000. 

   In the U.S., Mr. Farber says, the unions need nothing less than a sweeping change of public attitudes. 
The unions, he says, have called for "reform of the National Labor Relations Act to provide an environment where current employer practices to discourage union organizing will be less effective. 
However, until our society as a whole is more favorably disposed toward unions, such reform will be difficult to achieve." 

   Both NBER studies stress that the key problem for the unions is winning over the workers themselves. 
"One recurring theme in the debate over the future of unions in the private sector is that the competitiveness of the economy has increased dramatically and that labor unions may be less viable in such an economic environment," Mr. Farber concludes. 
"Unions need to convince workers that they offer real value in the modern competitive economy."

   The late-afternoon buying spree that boosted the Dow Jones Industrial Average also lifted Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks, as the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.65, or 0.6%, to 449.12. 

   Patrick Ryan, manager of OTC trading at Johnston, Lemon &amp; Co. in Washington, said the buying came from professional traders and market makers trading for their own accounts and was a response to the 1.2% jump in the industrial average on the New York Stock Exchange, most of which came in the final half-hour of trading. 

   If institutional investors decide to get in on the action and buy OTC stocks today, Mr. Ryan said, the Nasdaq market could advance without further prompting from the Big Board. 

   "There seems to be optimism, but it all happened in the last hour," Mr. Ryan said. 
"We'll have to see what happens" today, he said. 

   Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., said investor reaction to this morning's government report on second-quarter gross national product growth also will be important. 
Yesterday's gain was "the first bright spot we've had in a while," he said. 
"But it doesn't mean anything until the GNP comes out." 

   Volume on Nasdaq remained lackluster as only 124.5 million shares changed hands. 
Of the 4,401 issues that traded, 1,124 advanced and 829 declined. 

   The barometers of the biggest OTC issues both were up, as the Nasdaq 100 Index of nonfinancial stocks gained 3.76 to 419.79 while the Nasdaq Financial Index rose 1.46 to 440.90. 

   Exchange Bancorp jumped 4 1/8 to 21 7/8 after Algemene Bank Nederland said its LaSalle National unit agreed in principle to acquire the Chicago commercial bank holding company for $24 a share, or $420 million. 

   American depositary receipts of Volvo rose 2 5/8 to 75 3/8. 
Volvo Concessionaires, a United Kingdom importer and distributor of the Swedish-made automobiles, plans to offer catalytic converters as a no-cost option on all Volvo models beginning next year, the London-based Financial Times reported. 

   Cerner rose 1 to 13 3/4. 
Several analysts made positive comments about the developer of clinical information systems, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said. 

   While many OTC technology stocks rebounded from sell-offs earlier in the week, Apple Computer lost 1/2 to 38 1/4. 

   Microsoft, which won a favorable ruling in a copyright suit brought by Apple, gained 3/4 to 52 3/4. 
Ashton-Tate rose 1/2 to 15. 
Software Publishing gained 5/8 to 21 1/8.

   Imperial Holly dropped 1 3/4 to 28 1/2, apparently on profit-taking. 
The company reported first-quarter net income of $4.1 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $882,000. 

   TCI International tumbled 1 5/8 to 8 5/8 after reporting that its third-quarter earnings slipped to 10 cents a share from 44 cents a share a year earlier. 

   Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it suspended trading for 10 days in securities of Lifeline Healthcare Group, beginning yesterday. 

   The commission said it acted because of questions about recent market activity in the securities and about the adequacy and accuracy of several kinds of information about the company. 

   In April, the Broken Arrow, Okla., company reported net income for 1988 of $717,564, or 63 cents a share, on revenue of $2.1 million. 
In May, it paid a 1-for-1 stock dividend to shareholders other than its officers and directors. 
The move was aimed at thwarting what Lifeline Healthcare said was abusive short selling of its stock. 
Short sellers bet that a stock's price will fall by borrowing shares and immediately selling them. 
Their aim is to profit by buying replacement shares later at a lower price. 

   A spokesman for the company said officials welcome the investigation and hope regulators can "get to the bottom" of the irregularities in the trading of the company's stock.

   Bethlehem Steel Corp., despite a 44% drop in second-quarter earnings, reinstated its quarterly dividend after a four-year lapse, citing a bolstered balance sheet. 

   Bethlehem, the nation's second-largest steel producer, said quarter earnings fell to $84 million from $151 million. 
The decline reflected hefty charges to restructure its BethForge operations, high steel-production costs, and the industry's stellar performance in the year-ago period. 

   Separately, two smaller steelmakers reported mixed second-quarter results. 
While specialty steelmaker Allegheny Ludlum Corp. reported a 40% rise in profit, mini-mill Nucor Corp. saw its profit drop 11% because of start-up costs at a new high-tech mill. 

   Bethlehem directors reinstated the 10-cents-a-share common stock dividend the company had been paying until September 1985. 
Walter F. Williams, chairman and chief executive officer, cited "the progress we have made in rebuilding our financial strength." 
The dividend is payable Sept. 10 to holders of record Aug. 10. 

   Wall Street has been expecting the dividend restoration since watching the company improve its balance sheet during the past few years and begin making sizable payments to its underfunded pension-plan fund. 
Some analysts also raised the dividend issue following a contract settlement with the United Steelworkers union, which restored wage sacrifices made in 1986 and boosted wages by $1.50 an hour during the life of the 50-month pact. 

   "To make restorations to labor without giving a penny in dividends to shareholders would have been inappropriate," said John Tumazos, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. 

   Bethlehem's basic steel operations continue to be plagued by higher production costs. 
Moreover, costs for raw materials such as alloys continued to rise in the quarter -- although at a slower rate than that of the first quarter -- at the same time the company saw its product mix shift to more semifinished steel, which has lower profit margins. 

   Operating profit in that segment dropped to $147 million from $166 million and affected all operations, including the large, modern Burns Harbor and Sparrows Point plants. 

   Mr. Williams said orders declined in the second quarter from strong first-quarter levels as a result of customer inventory adjustments, seasonal factors and an easing of demand from the automotive industry. 
He anticipates second-half shipments to fall from first-half levels. 
Total domestic industry shipments, he predicted, would fall 3.6% in 1989 to 81 million tons from 84 million in 1988. 

   Still, notes Michelle Galanter Applebaum, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., Bethlehem's profits per ton of steel shipped rose to $58 a ton in the latest quarter from $52 a ton in the first period. 
That was lower, though, than last year's second-quarter level of $63 a ton, when the industry didn't have the high raw material costs. 

   At specialty steelmaker Allegheny Ludlum, net surged to $36.7 million, or $1.63 a share, from $27.3 million, or $1.16 a share. 
Sales rose to $333.8 million from $318.2 million a year ago. 
Although demand for stainless steel remains strong, Allegheny Ludlum noted that an uncertain economy, as well as the decline in raw-material prices for some products, has prompted steel service centers and other users to postpone purchases in anticipation of lower prices. 
The company forecast lower third-quarter earnings. 

   At Nucor Corp., earnings dropped to $32.2 million, or $1.51 a share, from $36 million, or $1.70 a share, a year ago in spite of higher sales. 
Sales rose 24.7% to $646.1 million from $518.1 million. 
The mini-mill said earnings were reduced by more than 25 cents a share in the quarter because of higher pre-operating and startup costs of new facilities.

<HL> Northeast Utilities Is Planning to Make
@  Improved Offer for PSNH, Sources Say

   Northeast Utilities plans to make an improved offer to acquire Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, a move that could end the stalemate over the New Hampshire company's bankruptcy-law proceedings, according to sources familiar with the case. 

   Northeast, which is expected to unveil the new proposal soon, has disclosed details of the plan to creditors and shareholders in hopes of winning support. 

   It isn't clear, however, if enough parties will go along with the Northeast plan for it to succeed. 
Moreover, negotiations over alternative plans -- including an internal reorganization -- are continuing. 
"Negotiations are at a critical juncture," said a person close to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization proceedings. 

   Parties that have been briefed by Northeast said that the Hartford, Conn.-based utility will offer $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion in cash plus around $400 million in preferred stock for all of PS of New Hampshire, including its 35.6% stake in the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant. 

   Northeast earlier proposed paying $1.2 billion for the operating assets of PS of New Hampshire and spinning off Seabrook to unsecured creditors and shareholders, and then acquiring Seabrook power -- if and when it begins operating -- in a transaction it valued at about $800 million. 

   Although the initial proposal had roughly the same dollar value as the new offer, investment bankers valued the first proposal at only about $1.3 billion because it involved far less cash and the value of the power-purchase contract was questionable. 
Thus, the latest offer is considered better. 
"This {latest offer} is cash rich," said one PS of New Hampshire creditor, who asked not to be identified. 
"When you dangle cash dollars in front of investors, they're more interested." 

   A spokesman for Northeast declined to comment on whether the company plans to make a new offering, saying only that "it's no secret that we've been involved in negotiations." 

   New England Electric System, based in Westboro, Mass., also has made an offer to acquire certain PS of New Hampshire assets in a package that it values at $2.35 billion, but that some investment bankers value at around $1.5 billion. 

   Northeast's latest proposal would require rate increases of 5.5% a year for five years, said one person familiar with the talks. 
That is in the range of rate increases that state of New Hampshire officials have indicated they would consider reasonable. 

   Sources said that Paul Gioia, an examiner in the case appointed by the court to try to speed negotiations, also is conducting talks with various parties over an internal reorganization plan that would involve annual rate increases of 5.9% for three years and up to 5.5% annually for an additional five years. 

   While an internal reorganization with those rate increases would place a higher value on the company, the state has balked at those increases as being too high. 
Because the state's objections could delay court approval of a reorganization plan, creditors may go along with the Northeast plan in order to resolve the case and get their money as soon as possible. 

   Equity holders, however, are expected to negotiate for a better offer. 
With creditors owed about $1.72 billion by PS of New Hampshire, a purchase of the company for $2 billion would leave less than $300 million for shareholders. 
"I think it needs to be a substantially higher deal . . . well north of $2 billion," said Wilbur Ross Jr., of Rothschild Inc., financial adviser to the equity committee. 

   One reason for the flurry of negotiations is that Mr. Gioia must report on the progress in the case next Monday. 
PS of New Hampshire filed for Chapter 11 in January 1988. 
The company's problem stem from the heavy debt it took on to help build Seabrook, which is completed but hasn't started operations because of controversy over its safety evacuation plan. 
Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to repay its debt.

<HL> Hertz Is Raising Rates for Both Business, Leisure Rentals

   Higher prices for new cars this fall are translating into higher rental rates for Hertz Corp.'s leisure and commercial customers, and probably for patrons of other rental firms as well. 

   The No. 1 rental company said it expects to raise rates across the board between 6% and 7% on Sept. 1. 
The increases would mean an average $3 to $4 more a day for commercial customers and $10 to $15 more a week for leisure renters. 
A Ford Tempo that now rents for $170 a week, for example, would cost $180 to $190 after the changes. 

   "We haven't had this kind of an increase in at least five years," said Craig R. Koch, president of Hertz's North America Rent A Car Division. 
"Our industry is just badly behind in passing through inflation" represented by higher costs for cars, licenses and titles, insurance, wages, facilities and advertising. 

   Other rental-car companies said they are studying the Hertz move closely. 
"We applaud their bravado," said Terry Redmond, executive vice president of National Car Rental System Inc. of Minneapolis. 
"We hope they stick with it. 
If anything can help and we can get our prices to better reflect our costs, we're happy." 

   That sentiment was echoed at Budget Rent a Car Corp. 
"We believe this may signal an industry trend," said Robert A. Wilson, vice president of marketing planning. 
"There is obviously a need for more revenue for the industry and unfortunately we're going to have to get it from our customers." 

   Closely held Hertz said the expectation of sharply higher new-car prices this fall was a major factor in its decision. 
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have told their dealers that prices on most 1990 models could go up as much as 7% to 9% from 1989 levels, largely because of new safety equipment required by federal law. 
"Car-cost increases of that magnitude simply cannot go unaccounted for," Mr. Koch said, adding that Hertz didn't raise its overall rates last fall when car prices increased. 

   But competitors pointed to other reasons why Hertz might need to jack up rates. 
Industry sources said the firm has lost some 10 points in market share over the past five years. 
In addition, fewer people flew domestic airlines during the first half of 1989 than a year earlier, and Hertz depends heavily on airport customers. 

   Still, Hertz isn't the only company feeling the pinch. 
In recent weeks, a number of rental concerns have raised prices to vacationers by about 5% to 10%. 
In some cities, increases were higher. 

   Business travelers were unaffected by these changes, but they aren't being left out in what is developing into a new round of increases. 
National's Mr. Redmond said it raised the guidelines by which its sales staff sells commercial rates by $4 a day effective Aug. 1. 

   Commercial rates go up as corporate contracts are renewed. 

   Moves such as this could be "extremely significant" for everyone concerned, said Charles H. Finnie, an analyst with Alex. 
Brown &amp; Sons Inc., an investment banking firm in Baltimore. 
There is tremendous pressure to keep down commercial rates, he says, adding that "companies have been willing to squeeze margins to almost nothing to get that business."

   The Federal Reserve has eased its grip on credit another notch, providing further confirmation that interest rates are headed down. 

   The latest move is the second part of a two-step action authorized by the central bank's policy committee at its meeting earlier this month. 
The Fed's move is likely to result in lower rates on bank loans and other consumer interest rates. 

   The Fed's action became apparent when, for the second day in a row, the central bank took no action to prevent a decline in the key federal funds interest rate. 
The move is expected to reduce the funds rate to about 9%, from its recent level of 9 1/4%. 
That, in turn, could encourage banks to reduce their prime lending rate from the current 10 1/2% to 11% range. 

   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made it clear in recent congressional testimony that the Fed is worried about the risk that the economy may be falling into recession. 
Fed Gov. Martha Seger underscored that risk in an interview yesterday. 

   "I see weakness in two industries -- housing and autos -- that's even greater than I expected," Ms. Seger said. 
"And I think that's going to slosh over into other areas of the economy." 

   Most Fed officials are less pessimistic than Ms. Seger, and say they think a downturn is unlikely. 
But they say they believe the risks of recession have increased, and favor a cautious easing of the Fed's credit stance. 
"I think the balance has shifted over the last two to three months to a greater risk of recession," said Roger Guffey, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank in an interview earlier this week. 
"But that has to be taken in context. 
Before . . . the last couple of months, inflation was really the risk." 

   The fed funds rate, which in recent years has been the Fed's principal policy target, is the rate banks charge on loans to each other. 
The Fed can largely determine that rate by buying or selling government securities to financial institutions. 

   The funds rate has dropped three-quarters of a percentage point since the Fed began easing credit in early June. 
The central bank has been reluctant to move more quickly, fearing that the economy's slowdown will prove to be temporary, and that inflation will begin to accelerate. 

   Bush administration officials have been urging a more rapid reduction in interest rates. 
But the Fed is likely to continue to move slowly and cautiously unless it sees new signs of a sharp slowdown. 

   Nevertheless, many analysts believe the Fed will eventually ease further. 
"In all likelihood, there are further easing moves ahead" because of "the slowdown in economic growth and the moderation in inflation," said Rudolf Thunberg, economist at Ried, Thunberg &amp; Co., a Westport, Conn., investment research firm. 

   The Fed's policy committee, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, has been divided in recent months between several of the Fed governors in Washington, who favor an easier policy, and many of the district Fed presidents, who are reluctant to ease credit. 
The committee's next meeting is scheduled for Aug. 22. 

   Bankers have been waiting for the Fed to act before matching Chase Manhattan Bank's recent move to cut its prime lending rate to 10 1/2% from 11%. 
Some bankers said that if the federal funds rate remains around 9% or 9 1/8%, that would persuade them to lower their prime, or base, rates soon, perhaps as early as today. 

   The fed funds rate actually fell well below 9% at one point yesterday, the final day of a two-week period in which banks settle their reserve positions with the central bank. 
Settlement days often cause sharp technical movements. 

   "It certainly looks as though the funds rate now is at 9% and, if that's the case, we'll see declines rather quickly" in the prime rate to 10 1/2%, says Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank, Los Angeles. 
"Banks have been waiting to see the funds rate move down" before cutting the prime rate. 

   She also expects further rate declines. 
"I think before the year is out, we'll see somewhat lower rates" as the Fed moves "to make sure that this soft landing stays a soft landing, rather than a hard landing," she said. 

   The prime rate commands widespread attention because it is used by banks as a benchmark to set rates on many types of consumer loans, such as home-equity loans. 
It is also used to set rates on loans to numerous small and medium-sized businesses.

   Miami Beach financier Victor Posner revived efforts to sell the electrical-contracting company, Fischbach Corp., accepting a $29.835-a-share cash offer for the concern. 

   Mr. Posner, chairman of Fischbach, controls the company through APL Corp., which owns 52.9% of Fischbach's common shares. 
APL has agreed to vote its shares for the merger. 

   The offer is being made by a group led by Asher DeVere, a British investor with real-estate and other interests. 
Howard Squadron, a lawyer with the firm of Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent &amp; Lehrer, who represents Mr. DeVere, said the group has a commitment from a banking house to finance the acquisition. 

   Fischbach has 3,912,099 shares outstanding, which would cost about $117 million at the proposed price; the total would be somewhat higher because of conversion of options at various prices on another 421,000 shares. 

   Mr. Posner's APL in mid-May said it reached a "general understanding" with Mr. DeVere's group to sell Fischbach at $35 a share, or $136.9 million. 
At the time, APL said $5 of the offer was conditional upon resolution of certain lawsuits. 

   Mr. Squadron said the buyers have "taken on the responsibility" of the suits "and reduced the price accordingly." 
The litigation involves construction contracts. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Fischbach closed at $25.125 a share, up 62.5 cents. 

   Fischbach was also the object of a $25-a-share tender offer last year from a company controlled by New York investor Andrew N. Heine. 

   Mr. Posner's involvement with Fischbach, including his move earlier this year to take operating control of Fischbach following the death of its chief executive officer, has led to suits from some Fischbach directors. 

   Fischbach said the merger offer is subject to approval by its board, certain regulatory approvals, and approval of a majority of shareholders.

   Paramount Communications Inc. is close to a sale of its Associates Corp. financial services unit in a transaction worth between $3 billion and $4 billion, according to Wall Street investment banking sources involved in the bidding. 

   Paramount declined to comment. 
The company put the unit on the block in April as part of a restructuring in which the company's name was changed to Paramount Communications from Gulf &amp; Western Inc. Paramount, which made the announcement two months prior to making its ill-fated hostile bid for Time Inc., said at the time that it wanted to focus on expanding its entertainment and publishing operations. 

   According to the Wall Street sources, a second round of bids for Associates was submitted on Monday, including bids from several domestic and foreign concerns. 
The identity of the bidders couldn't be learned, but they are said to include insurance companies and other credit concerns. 

   Associates accounted for about 46% of Paramount's operating profit last year, and has long served as a cushion against its cyclical entertainment and publishing businesses such as Paramount Pictures and Simon &amp; Schuster. 
But Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis has said that Associates doesn't fit into his long-range strategic plans for the company. 

   Paramount had planned to use the proceeds from the sale to help pay the debt it would have incurred in its proposed $12 billion acquisition of Time. 
The company has said it will now explore other opportunities for expansion in the entertainment business, and it is expected to use the proceeds from the Associates to help finance another acquisition. 

   Paramount acquired Associates in 1968, and over the past two decades has agressively expanded in the consumer and commercial finance business. 
In 1988, the unit had revenue of $2.05 billion and $372.4 million in operating income. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Paramount shares closed at $58.125, down 25 cents.

   Mortgage lenders across the country discourage borrowers of small amounts by charging extra fees for loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, critics say. 

   Mortgage-rate sheets from various lenders indicate many tack on fees of as much as 5%, or five so-called mortgage discount points, for small loans. 
A federal law passed in 1987 prohibits lenders from setting a minimum amount for FHA loans, but opponents of the practice say the extra fees deter low-income home buyers from applying for smaller loans. 

   A Housing and Urban Development spokesman said the department currently has no position on the extra fees. 
All HUD programs are being reviewed at the instruction of HUD Secretary Jack Kemp. 
The department is in the midst of congressional and internal investigations following accusations of influence-peddling, embezzlement, poor management and a lack of agency control over outside contractors. 

   Surveys by the Chicago-based National Training and Information Center, a resource center for community organizations, found mortgage lenders routinely added extra fees to their small loans. 
Gale Cincotta, executive director of the center, said the high fees for smaller loans amount to "redlining and denying people access to credit." 
Low-income and moderate-income home buyers are "discriminated against and penalized," because the lenders "just don't want to make smaller loans," she said. 
"They want to do the big, big stuff." 

   The additional points can equal significantly higher charges for those seeking small loans. 
A point is equal to one percentage point of the face amount of the mortgage. 

   Home Loan Corp. in Houston, for example, charges a 5% fee for loans less than $40,000 and no additional points for loans above $60,000. 
This could result in a home buyer having to pay almost $2,000 in additional costs. 
Ben Streusand, president of Home Loan, declined to comment about the rate structure. 

   Walter Buczynski, a senior vice president with Margaretten &amp; Co. in Perth Amboy, N.J., said his company and many others charge additional points for the smaller loans nationwide because the 1% fee allowed by the FHA isn't enough to meet their expenses. 
Margaretten charges five additional points for loans under$15,000. 

   Brian Chappell, a vice president of Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, a mortgage banking trade group, disagreed with the practice. 
"That's wrong," said Mr. Chappell. 
"That violates the spirit of the (minimum loan) law." 

   Tom Gobby, a vice president for the Talman Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Illinois, Chicago, agreed. 
"It's discriminating. 
It goes beyond discouraging. 
There is a question of basic morality, for crying out loud." 
Mr. Gobby said that although lenders don't make as much on small loans, Talman didn't charge additional points. 
"You work that into the cost of business," he said. 

   American Securities Mortgage Co. in Houston charges 3% more for loans less than $30,000. 
"I don't want to turn them (low-income buyers) away and say you're not buying enough house," Jeanne Sanders, a vice president of the firm, said. 
"To me that would be more discriminatory." 

   A survey by the National Training and Information Center indicates that seven of the nation's largest mortgage companies charge additional points for small FHA loans. 

   "It all has to do with the cost of money," said Charles Sandine, senior vice president of Guaranty Bank for Savings, Milwaukee. 
"Risk has nothing to do with it." 
Guaranty charges two additional points for loans under $20,000. 

   "The Congress is going to have to find a way to ensure that low-income potential home buyers are served by this program and are not discriminated against," said Scott Baker, a spokesman for Rep. Thomas Ridge. 
Mr. Ridge, a Pennsylvania Republican, sponsored the law prohibiting lenders from setting a loan minimum. 

   "If we don't solve this, what we will have is mortgage bankers . . . just serving the upper market," Mr. Baker said.

<HL> Regulators Order
@  Pinnacle West S&amp;L
@  To Add Capital

   Federal regulators demanded about $192 million in added capital at MeraBank, Arizona's largest savings and loan, renewing pressure on the thrift's parent. 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said that its MeraBank unit has been ordered to add the capital by Monday. 

   Analysts saw the move as an effort by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to force Pinnacle West to bolster the troubled thrift. 
"Regulators seem to be putting pressure on Pinnacle West to see if it will come up with the money," said Edward J. Tirello, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Mr. Tirello added that he expects Pinnacle West to borrow the funds needed to meet MeraBank's new capital requirement. 

   A spokesman for Pinnacle West declined to comment on either the company's borrowing capacities or its plans. 
Pinnacle West said it disputes the FHLB order "as a legal matter," although the company spokesman said no legal action opposing the regulatory order has been filed. 

   Pinnacle West, which is based in Phoenix, Ariz., is a holding company whose other interests include Arizona Public Service Co., the state's largest electric utility; a venture capital company; uranium mining operations; and real estate. 
Almost all of its operations, other than the electrical utility, are troubled. 

   The FHLB's order to MeraBank, which has been anticipated since late last month, formally disallows good will as part of the thrift's regulatory capital. 
Good will is a noncash accounting for intangible items on a balance sheet. 

   MeraBank's traditional regulatory capital, including good will, totaled $265 million -- some $65 million above the minimum -- at June 30. 
However, without good will, its tangible capital is in deficit by $192 million. 

   In a letter dated July 24, the FHLB directed that MeraBank boost its tangible capital from its negative balance to zero by Monday. 
Regulators also ordered MeraBank to boost its tangible capital to 1.5% of total assets by June 30, 1990, and to 3% of total assets by June 30, 1991. 

   In an apparent effort to meet the future capital requirements, MeraBank said earlier this month that it will stop making new loans and will jettison assets -- steps that would reduce the amount of needed new capital. 
Gene E. Rice, chairman and chief executive officer of MeraBank, said he expects assets to shrink to about $4.5 billion in three years from $8.28 billion at March 31, 1989. 

   These steps may help MeraBank in the long run, but Pinnacle West is in something of an immediate regulatory squeeze. 
On the one hand, federal thrift regulators are calling for it to inject more money. 
On the other, the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates Pinnacle West's cash-rich utility operation, has limited the dividends that Arizona Public Service can pay to its parent, thus limiting the most obvious source of funds. 

   The FHLB order relies on a rarely used power to require an "individual minimum capital requirement" that is much more stringent than that currently imposed on most thrifts. 
The new requirement at MeraBank is separate from legislative steps that will greatly tighten reserve requirements for thrifts across the country, but at a much slower pace. 

   FHLB officials declined to discuss regulatory actions with MeraBank or any other specific institution. 
However, a spokeswoman said that the bank's power to order changes in capital requirements has the legal standing and enforceability of a cease and desist order.

   When it announces its first laptop computer next month, Apple Computer Inc. expects its loyalists to flock to the machine in droves. 
The Cupertino, Calif., firm is so concerned about sky-high demand for the machine that it fears its sole outside supplier of the laptop's screens may wilt under the onslaught of orders. 

   At Businessland Inc., the big personal-computer retailer, store managers can't get their hands on enough of Apple's Macintosh and International Business Machines Corp.'s PS/2 computers equipped with new communications software. 
Novell Inc. and 3Com Corp., the biggest makers of networking software that links PCs, both expect big sales gains in the next 12 months. 
And Compaq Computer Corp. is selling so many advanced machines that one of its main suppliers, disk-drive maker Conner Peripherals Inc., said yesterday its second-quarter sales more than tripled to $164 million. 

   This is a slump? 

   The personal computer industry is, indeed, slowing down, to an estimated overall growth rate of 10% or so from nearly twice that a year ago. 
But the trend disguises a central fact about the PC business -- rather than slumping broadly, it is increasingly divided between winners and losers. 
The makers of the most advanced machines, and the software companies that specialize in linking them, are still going strong, while hardware and software concerns with older products are experiencing such sharp drops in sales that many are reporting losses. 
One problem for the winners is that investors aren't distinguishing them from the losers, as most PC-related stocks have taken a beating in the past several months. 

   In part, the widening gulf between winners and losers reflects the growing strength of three industry powerhouses. 
This year, Compaq and Apple have cemented their status -- along with IBM -- as the dominant hardware suppliers in the industry. 
IBM, which doesn't break out its PC results, said in June that its sales of those machines were growing at an annual rate of 40%, faster than expected. 

   "Before, the three were leaders," says Charles R. Wolf, an analyst at First Boston Corp. in New York. 
"Today, they are dominant and are building a widening lead over the second tier." 

   Mr. Wolf believes that this year and next, these three firms will account for virtually all of the growth in PC sales world-wide, leaving a bevy of smaller competitors to fight over a stagnant market. 
He estimates that personal-computer sales by Apple, Compaq and IBM will grow a combined 25% this year and 20% in 1990. 
"I have the rest of the market being flat," Mr. Wolf says. 

   The gap between winners and losers also is seen in software, where Microsoft Corp. is increasingly dominant. 
On Tuesday, the company said it expects sales in its current fiscal year, which began July 1, to rise 25% to $1 billion. 

   The software industry remains populated by scores of companies, but few have forged a broad, effective strategy. 
Companies which rely heavily on single products, such as Lotus Development Corp. with its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, Ashton-Tate Corp. with its data-base management program and Aldus Corp. with its Pagemaker publishing program, have seen their stars dim. 
Companies with broader offerings, meanwhile, are gaining appeal, partly because "customers think it's more important to integrate applications," says John Zeisler, vice president of marketing at Claris Corp., a software company owned by Apple. 

   Software companies also are suffering from trying to adapt existing programs to new operating systems. 
"The biggest growth area is moving existing products to these new platforms," says Gordon Eubanks, chief executive officer of Symantec Corp., a Cupertino, Calif., software maker. 

   Chasing these opportunities, however, has exhausted scarce programming resources, and -- what's worse -- hasn't paid off yet. 
Many software companies have adapted popular programs to Microsoft's OS/2 operating system, but customers have been slow to buy OS/2. 
Microsoft still estimates that it will sell one million copies of OS/2 in 1990, but others aren't so sure. 
"I haven't seen a big push from anybody for OS/2," says Phillip E. White, chief executive officer at Informix Software Inc. 

   The time spent on OS/2 has had another adverse effect, diverting attention from customer problems. 
"The basic problem is that for 18 months the industry has been talking to itself," says Stewart Alsop, editor of the PC Letter, a newsletter. 
"That's confused the customer, who's decided to hold off on purchases." 

   The problem in hardware is different: customers know what they want, but seemingly can't get enough. 
For large corporate buyers, speed and power are the most wanted features. 

   That has resulted in a split in the hardware market between makers of low-powered and high-powered computers. 
Sales of machines using Intel Corp.'s fast 80386 microprocessor are growing more than 30% annually, while sales of machines using less powerful microprocessors are eroding, says Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter. 

   "The trend toward higher-performance systems is clear," says Safi Qureshey, chief executive officer of AST Research Inc., Irvine, Calif., which makes personal computers and related products. 
"Companies that are focusing on this are doing reasonably well." 

   Mr. Qureshey says AST has withdrawn from several peripheral businesses to concentrate on supplying more powerful personal computers, including a new machine using Intel's 80486 microprocessor, that company's newest and most powerful. 

   Both IBM and Compaq, which have strong 80386 offerings, are benefiting from the enthusiasm for higher-powered machines. 
Apple, which offers similarly powered machines using processors from Motorola Inc., also is benefiting. 

   Although the emphasis on powerful machines is driving PC sales, the trend worries some industry officials. 
These computers cost much more than lower-powered machines, so they mask slowing growth in unit sales. 
"That scares me," says Claris's Mr. Zeisler. 
"Are we trading higher dollars for fewer customers?"

@  Elusive for DAT Players

   Most people thought the hard part in getting digital audio tape on the market would be answering the question of copyright protection. 
That appears done, but don't count on buying a moderately priced player anytime soon -- some technical and economic hurdles remain. 

   After three years of pitched battle, an agreement between record companies and audio equipment makers on a copyright protection plan will be announced tomorrow. 
While a number of industry executives and analysts are excited about the technology, they warn that it may take time before it becomes the latest rage among audiophiles, if it happens at all. 

   So-called DAT machines record and play sounds digitally, similar to compact disk players, which can't record. 
And DAT machines reproduce sound more clearly and accurately than conventional analog tapes, which some analysts say eventually could be rendered obsolete by the new product. 

   Every major Japanese and European consumer electronics company has had the ability to make DAT machines for at least two years. 
But the machines haven't been mass-marketed here because of a bitter dispute between makers and record companies, who fear the high-quality recordings could spur extensive copyright violations. 
That issue could be resolved by the settlement, which in part limits the ability of DAT machines to copy from compact disks. 

   Record-industry reaction to the settlement is mixed so far. 
CBS Records, purchased two years ago by Sony Corp., could play a big role in the success of DAT, since it is the world's largest record company and its parent company is one of the most powerful consumer electronics giants -- and a big proponent of DAT. Tommy Mottola, president of CBS Records, believes digital audio tape will begin making inroads in the next year and a half, and "will give another surge of sales to our industry." 
He says DAT sound quality is "comparable to, if not better than, compact disk," and he predicts that ultimately the DAT technology "will be the one to walk away with the whole ball game." 
At Warner Communications Inc.'s Warner Records unit -- which isn't tied to a hardware maker like Sony -- executives are cautiously optimistic about DAT. 

   "Once you solve the taping problem, we've always been a believer in the technology," says Geoffrey Holmes, an executive vice president of Warner. 
"Any system that enhances the quality of the material of performing artists is something we're in favor of," he adds, as long as it can be done in a cost-effective way. 

   But at Bertelsmann AG's Bertelsmann Music Group, which includes RCA Records, co-chairman Michael Dornemann says the copyright protections offered under the agreement aren't sufficient. 
Under the settlement, machine producers must install a device that allows users to make one copy from a compact disk onto a digital tape, but prevents a second generation of copying -- from one digital tape to another. 

   Mr. Dornemann notes that an unlimited number of copies can still be made from the original. 
He says record producers and artists should be compensated for the increased possibility of copying by a royalty on blank DAT tapes and DAT equipment. 
"With respect to this goal, the agreement offers little," he says. 
"The hardware industry is not prepared to support the request for royalty." 

   And some industry executives say they can't understand why record companies support DAT at all. 
"I cannot, in the furthest reaches of my imagination, think why any of the major record companies would embrace it," says Russ Solomon, president of the Tower Records chain, based in Sacramento, Calif. 
"I'd be surprised if they really came to the party. 
They know that if they do support the software end in a big way, it will fuel the hardware market," bringing more high-quality recording equipment into the home. 

   Mr. Solomon says the copyright-protection agreement "finally gets rid of the strife between hardware and software manufacturers," who now "don't have to be in opposing armed camps." 
But he is pessimistic about the potential for a mass market. 
"DAT doesn't make that much difference, and there's not that much demand on the part of the public," he says. 
"DAT focuses on on a fairly limited audiophile market." 

   One of the biggest impediments to widespread sales so far is price. 
Some professional units are available here from $995 to $2,000, and consumer machines would likely be priced in the same range. 
Virtually no consumer models are sold here now, though JVC Co. of America, a unit of the Japan-based concern, sells some DAT systems for luxury cars. 
Tower Records is selling some pre-recorded tapes for $25 to $30, but fewer than 100 titles are available. 
Blank tapes are $7 to $20. 

   In Japan -- by far the biggest market right now -- machines generally sell in the range of about 200,000 yen (about $1,400). 
While most new high-priced consumer electronics items are later drastically marked down as demand grows, many in the industry question whether prices for DAT machines, because of their technical complexity, can ever be slashed low enough to become mass consumer items. 
Warner officials, for example, doubt that DAT machines can ever be priced below the $300 level that has spurred sales of compact disk players and videocassette recorders. 

   In Japan, for example, when most Japanese companies started selling the machines in 1987, they expected to sell large amounts quickly. 
But sales have been much slower than expected. 
Hitachi Ltd., which planned in 1987 to make up to 1,000 units a month, has now halted production. 

   Even with the new agreement, many companies may be slow to produce in the volume necessary to push down prices. 
Officials were reluctant to discuss their plans openly yesterday in advance of the settlement's formal announcement. 
But some privately said they will proceed cautiously, rather than once again investing heavily only to see demand evaporate. 

   "We hope good cooperation now exists, but we are not confident," a spokesman for one leading Japanese company said. 
"We are anxious about the next new problem. 
We now have a wait-and-see attitude." 

   In April, Nakamichi America Corp., a Torrance, Calif., unit of Nakamichi Corp. of Tokyo, shipped its Model 1000, a ultra-high-end model that carries a ultra-high-end list price of $10,000. 
Jett Logan, Nakamichi's vice president for sales and marketing, said at the time that his company expected to sell 500 units in the first year at that price. 
"DAT hasn't met our expectation," he said this week. 
"We are selling product, but it certainly isn't running out the door. 
The confusion that has existed up till now has hurt sales of the product." 
Mr. Logan said the news of the agreement is "welcome," and hopes it will "remove the cloud that has hung over DAT." 

   Some analysts don't believe that consumers will take to a machine whose copying abilities are limited, and believe the idea of a royalty payment from the proceeds of each blank tape sold will have to be considered eventually. 
Barry Dargan, an analyst in the Tokyo office of James Capel Pacific Ltd., predicts, "I suspect they'll have to come back in a year or two and amend the agreement."

   Cummins Engine Co. stock jumped as the second foreign company in the past eight months acquired a major stake in the big diesel machine and automotive parts maker. 

   Cummins, whose founding family's descendants bought Hanson USA's 8.8% stake earlier this month for $72 million, ridding the company of that distraction, is now confronted by an even larger holding that could lead to a takeover attempt. 
Hanson USA is the U.S. arm of Hanson PLC of London. 

   Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., a Hong Kong-based concern 70%-owned by Brierley Investments Ltd. in New Zealand, disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it holds a 9.9% stake in Cummins. 
Industrial Equity said it bought the shares for investment purposes but reserves the right to change its plans. 

   In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday after the stake was disclosed, Cummins stock price closed at $60.25, up $2.50 a share. 

   A tender offer by Industrial Equity "wouldn't be difficult for them with the strong financing we understand they have," said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. 
But he said Brierley's usual style is to take long-term investment positions in foreign companies. 
"To my knowledge, they have never acquired one in the U.S.," said Mr. Lustgarten. 

   Other analysts speculated that the stake may be an attempt at some form of "greenmail" -- forcing Cummins to buy back the Industrial Equity stake at a steep profit. 
When Hanson's stake was bought earlier this month, it was descendants of the Cummins family, rather than the company itself, that paid. 

   Although Cummins and the family acclaimed the purchase of the Hanson stake, saying it wasn't greenmail, analysts said that transaction may make such stakes more inviting to investors. 
The Cummins family members involved took a $5 million loss, based on Cummins's stock price before the purchase. 

   Mr. Lustgarten said Industrial Equity "could be after greenmail, or they could be in it for the long term. 
Right now, we don't know." 

   A Cummins spokeswoman said an Industrial Equity official telephoned earlier this week. 
Based on that discussion and the SEC filing, she said: "We tend to take them at their word" that the new stake is merely for investment purposes. 

   Cummins is rebounding from an earnings slump last year. 
In the second quarter ended July 2, net income was $23.9 million, or 83 cents a share, up from $1.7 million a year earlier, when preferred dividend requirements exceeded any per-share profit. 
Sales rose to $982 million from $834.4 million. 

   Cummins has been investing heavily in new products to compete more effectively with overseas engine makers and to meet pollution guidelines, depressing profit in recent quarters. 

   When the Cummins family descendants bought Hanson's stake, they received a so-called standstill agreement from the London-based concern, requiring for 10 years the family's permission to buy Cummins shares.

   Aesthetic issues of the Alaskan oil spill aside, state and federal officials worry mostly about the impact of soiled beaches on wildife. 
As the bird-carcass count approaches 28,000, scientists estimate that the total bird kill, including those whose bodies have sunk or were eaten by scavengers, is at least 50,000, about 10% of the area's population. 
Among the victims: 109 bald eagles. 
Nesting populations have been decimated on some of Prince William Sound's hardest-hit islands. 
On some islands where eagles have survived, nesting birds have experienced "almost complete reproductive failure," says Phil Schempf, a specialist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Valdez. 
Prespill estimates of the sound's eagle population were 2,000 birds. 
The official death toll of sea otters is 872, and a few more are still dying in the Gulf of Alaska. 
The otter carcasses recovered probably represent only half or fewer of those killed, officials say. 
Though there are not yet accurate counts, several hundred seals died following the spill, and oily beaches are also thought to be responsible for the deaths of numerous seal pups born on oil-soaked beaches this summer. 
And the spill closed the sound's $12 million herring fishery earlier this year. 
About 30% of the salmon grounds have recently been put off limits to fishing because of moving oil and oily beaches near spawning grounds. 
Rich salmon fisheries off Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska and in Cook Inlet near Homer have been closed, costing fishermen there tens of millions of dollars.

@  Acquisition by Whitney Thrown in Doubt

   Prime Computer Inc. reported a $19 million loss on a 6.5% decline in sales for the second quarter, throwing its plan to be acquired by J.H. Whitney &amp; Co. into doubt. 

   Whitney, which has agreed to acquire Prime in a deal valued at $1.2 billion, said that its banks Tuesday evening demanded that Whitney arrange "substantial additional" financing because of Prime's weak operating results. 

   The loss apparently led the banks to question whether Prime has a strong enough cash flow to cover heavy interest costs related to the acquisition. 
Whitney said it is negotiating with the banks and with "a major financial institution" to arrange the needed financing. 

   Prime's stock fell $1.375 to $15.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as arbitragers worried about the fate of the Whitney takeover. 
"I still think Whitney wants to do it," said one arbitrager holding Prime stock. 
"If they don't, we're" in trouble. 

   Jay P. Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter, said "my own view is that the lenders are beginning to realize there are problems in the industry and the price of Prime is too high." 
He asked: "With the computer industry hemorrhaging, what is Prime worth?" 
Chemical Banking Corp.'s Chemical Bank unit and Bank of Boston Corp.'s First National Bank of Boston had agreed to provide $600 million of senior debt financing for the acquisition. 
Whitney said the agreements were conditioned on the banks' being satisfied that there is sufficient additional debt and equity financing to fund the offer and meet Prime's ongoing needs. 

   Late last month, Whitney emerged as an eleventh-hour acquirer of Prime, apparently rescuing it from a seven-month-old hostile tender offer by MAI Basic Four Inc., Tustin, Calif. 
Whitney offered $21.50 a share in cash for 49.5 million Prime shares, and $22 face amount of debentures for 13 million additional shares. 
It extended its offer one day to Friday. 

   Whitney and Prime officials couldn't be reached for further comment. 
One individual familiar with the transaction said "J.H. 
Whitney remains committed to seeing this transaction through to its end. 
The timing and circumstances are being worked out now." 

   Prime continues to resist the hostile tender offer by MAI Basic Four of $19.50 a share in cash for 49.5 million shares and $21 face amount of debentures for the remaining shares. 
MAI extended that offer to today but analysts give it little chance so long as the Whitney offer remains in place. 

   MAI last week offered a plan under which Prime would sell its minicomputer business to MAI for $450 million in cash and $150 million in debentures. 
It suggested Prime could use the proceeds for a stock buy-back. 
Yesterday, Prime said its directors believe the Whitney offer is preferable. 

   In another development, Prime adjourned its annual meeting from yesterday to Aug. 9 to give its holders more of an opportunity to study the latest MAI proposal. 
MAI has nominated a slate of directors to unseat the incumbents, and said they would sell Prime's minicomputer business to MAI if they were elected. 

   Prime said its financial results would have been stronger if it weren't for the high costs and customer uncertainty related to its ongoing anti-takeover battle. 

   Anthony Craig, president and chief executive officer said after the adjourned meeting that second-quarter results were "disappointing." 
The loss contrasted with year earlier net income of $7.2 million, or 15 cents a share. 
Revenue fell to $382 million from $408.4 million. 

   Mr. Craig said that pretax, non-recurring charges, including a $20 million payment to Whitney as reimbursement for its expenses, amounted to $27.3 million in the quarter. 
Before such costs the company had a pretax operating profit of about $10 million, he said. 

   Most midrange computer makers have been reporting weak results in recent quarters, and Prime's problems are exacerbated by the uncertainty over its possible acquisition, said Barry Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. 

   For the first six months, Prime reported a loss of $24 million, compared with net income of $21.7 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue fell to $768.9 million from $772.1 million.

   Technology stocks were trounced yesterday. 

   Even as broad market indexes rallied to all-time highs yesterday, panic selling prevailed in technology shares as investors dumped everything from International Business Machines Corp. to Apple Computer Inc. 

   Cray Research Inc. was the biggest loser on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, falling $2.125 to $42 a share. 
Among other technology stocks, IBM dropped 25 cents to $112.50, Compaq Computer Corp. tumbled $1.25 to $86.875, Prime Computer Inc. slipped $1.375 to $15.75. 
In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Amdahl Corp. shares fell 62.5 cents to $15. 

   Reflecting investor pessimism about the computer industry, Compaq shares fell even though the company reported that second-quarter earnings rose to $1.96 a share from $1.46 a year earlier. 
No matter what the second-quarter results so far are for a variety of computer stocks, analysts and investors are forecasting a miserable performance for the technology sector in the second half of 1989. 

   Privately, the chief executive officers of many computer firms are advising analysts to lower their sights for 1989. 
Yesterday, Cray Research had a private conference call with analysts and "didn't lead investors to look for a rebound," said Patricia Laupheimer, a computer-industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 

   While the stock market ascends to new highs, the sell-off in technology stocks underscores just how skittish investors are about the impact of an economic downturn. 

   "Investors don't do too much on good earnings, but when they see bad earnings, they rip stocks apart," said Jack Baker, head of equity block trading at Shearson. 

   Indeed, forecasts of slower economic growth ahead in the U.S. and Europe are a major factor squashing technology stocks. 
"A lot of these companies didn't see the slowdown coming and didn't make necessary adjustments," said William Easterbrook, a computer analyst and senior vice president at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 

   Aside from slow growth, analysts said a decline in U.S. defense spending will hurt earnings of computer firms this year. 
Also, computer users aren't upgrading systems fast enough to absorb all the new products firms are producing, analysts say. 

   The high-tech sell-off has punished Big Board and over-the-counter shares. 

   Unisys Corp., a Big Board stock, is down to lows not seen in about three years, finishing at $20.75 yesterday, for a gain of 50 cents. 
The Nasdaq 100 Index, heavily weighted with OTC technology shares, has fallen 3% since July 17. 
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index, a broad market measure, is off only 1%. 

   Among the recent casualties of the high-tech sell-off: 

   Apple Computer, after reporting on July 18 third-quarter earnings slightly above last year's, told analysts to take a cautious view of its earnings prospects over the near term. 
The advice prompted a number of analysts to slash future earnings estimates for Apple, and the stock lost 3.7% in active trading that day. 

   On the same day, Intel Corp. announced earnings at the low end of analyst expectations, and its stock tumbled 8% on heavy volume. 

   Microsoft Corp. had its turn Tuesday. 
Although the software maker's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings surged 48%, it forecast that a computer-industry bellwether, microprocessor unit growth, would expand only 10% over the next 12 months. 
The company also indicated that its new OS/2 operating system for PCs hasn't been selling well and that some analysts' estimates of fiscal 1990 earnings are high. 
Some analysts had been forecasting 1990 profit growth of about 25%. 
Microsoft's stock fell 6% on the news. 

   Meanwhile, Ashton-Tate Co. plummeted 11% Tuesday after announcing that it suffered a second-quarter loss of $19.8 million. 
The software company earned $11.5 million a year earlier.

   Current and former Internal Revenue Service employees told a House subcommittee that they were harassed by superiors in the agency after reporting violations by fellow employees. 

   Although many of those testifying said they felt they were victims of isolated retaliation, most said changes are necessary in the IRS's internal-security system to ensure that employee misconduct is uncovered and corrected. 

   "I have seen instances of preferred treatment for senior officials of the IRS and a coerced resignation of an employee who had uncovered malfeasance by a senior management official," said Stanley Shirai, a special agent in the IRS's Los Angeles office who investigates income-tax evasion. 

   The employees testified on the second day of hearings by the Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee into ethical conduct and standards at the IRS. 
The hearings, which follow a year-long investigation by the panel, focused on eight cases of alleged wrongdoing by 25 senior IRS officials, including taking gratuities from a businessman while providing him with confidential tax information and improperly intervening in a Justice Department tax investigation. 
Committee investigators say they have turned up at least 25 more incidents of what they regard as serious misconduct. 

   The subcommittee has been paying particular attention to how the IRS investigated the employees once the allegations came to light and whether it disciplined them appropriately. 

   In one case, three former employees and one current employee in the IRS's Los Angeles office said there was a perception in the office that an inspection supervisor -- responsible for examining charges of employee misconduct -- was too close to the people she was supposed to be investigating. 
One employee who complained that the perception was discouraging witnesses from talking about one case was told by Washington that headquarters officials had decided against taking her off the case. 

   The subcommittee also heard from three employees who in 1984 told a regional inspector that their supervisor had been providing confidential tax information to a Chicago businessman, accepting theater tickets and other gifts from the businessman, and otherwise violating agency rules. 

   Two of the employees, Stanley Welli and Ronald Koperniak, said they were snubbed after the incident and eventually demoted. 
They have since been restored to their positions, after appealing to higher IRS officials. 
The third, George Ecola, said he was ordered to transfer to another city. 
After he refused to move "because it was retaliation," his superiors withdrew their order. 
But he said he stopped receiving merit pay increases, and that in 1985, for the first time in 22 years of service, his performance rating was less than "above average." 

   Mr. Koperniak said a regional inspector said to the three employees: "The organization will get you." 

   An IRS spokeswoman said, "Our basic longstanding policy is all employees have an obligation to report wrongdoing they see. 
And the corollary to that is you have to feel confident you can report it, and it will be investigated properly, and not have any fear you will be retaliated against." 

   The subcommittee may seek to have the IRS's internal inspection operations put under a special inspector general's office answering only to the IRS commissioner. 
It might also seek to transfer some inspection functions to the Treasury Department's inspector general. 
Though the IRS is part of Treasury, the Treasury inspector general's office normally only reviews IRS cases; it isn't actively involved in them.

   Zenith Electronics Corp. named a chief financial officer and a new treasurer in the wake of the company's recently disclosed foul-up in not hedging against a rise in the dollar. 

   The Glenview, Ill., computer and consumer-electronics firm said it named Kell B. Benson, 41 years old, as chief financial officer and vice president for finance, and Willard C. McNitt, 40, as vice president and treasurer. 

   In taking the title of chief financial officer, Mr. Benson assumes a post that had been vacant since May 1988. 
Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said in a memo to employees that the move "will strengthen further the coordination between the company's controller and treasury functions." 
Mr. Benson continues in his position as controller. 

   Mr. McNitt, the new treasurer, succeeds David S. Levin in that post. 
A spokesman said Mr. Levin will report to Mr. McNitt in a new position as executive director of financial services. 
Mr. Levin couldn't be reached for comment. 
Mr. McNitt had been vice president and treasurer at Gould Inc., a computer and electronics concern acquired by Nippon Mining Co. last year. 

   Asked if the changes were related to the mistake in hedging against the dollar, a spokesman said "no comment." 

   Last Friday, Zenith reported a widened second-quarter loss and said it may not meet its previous projection that it would be more profitable this year than last year. 
The company in large part blamed its failure to protect itself against a wrong guess on the direction of the U.S. dollar. 
The company had thought the dollar would weaken this year, but it rose. 

   Mr. Pearlman said in an interview Friday that the company could have limited its risk by hedging with foreign exchange options instead of forward exchange contracts. 
Not doing so resulted in what he termed a "$25 million dollar problem -- "the total pretax effect this year if exchange rates stay where they are. 

   Last year, Zenith earned $11.7 million, or 45 cents a share, on sales of $2.69 billion. 

   Mr. Pearlman wouldn't comment Friday when asked if the mistake would lead to any executive changes at Zenith. 

   One securities analyst yesterday questioned whether the moves would make much difference in the company's performance. 
"The company has for years generated billions of dollars of revenue without profit," said Mark Hassenberg, who follows Zenith for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. "Changing one or two people in the organization is not going to change the problem."

<HL> IBM Agrees to Purchase a 19.8% Stake
@  In Policy Management for $116.5 Million

   International Business Machines Corp. agreed to buy 19.8% of Policy Management Systems Corp. for $116.5 million, marking the biggest purchase yet in its accelerating investment drive. 

   In the past year and a half, IBM has bought pieces of nearly a dozen companies, stepping up the pace in recent months. 
The computer giant is mainly trying to buy technology or expertise in certain areas such as software for insurance companies in the case of its Policy Management stake. 
IBM also seems to be trying to buy software developers' loyalty in the increasingly competitive industry. 

   Together with recent moves to increase its ability to install and even operate computer systems for customers, the investment strategy means IBM is forging ahead with its plans to turn itself into a software and services company that happens to make its own computer hardware. 

   An IBM spokesman says IBM doesn't have any targets for the number of investments it will make. 
"We're trying to pick and choose," he says. 
"It's not like we want to do one a month." 
But he said there will probably be more. 

   Consultants and industry executives say they expect many more. 
They say, though, that the investments will follow the scattershot approach of recent months, because, under IBM's new decentralized management structure, the investment decisions are being made primarily by the numerous independent business units. 

   Like many big companies, IBM doesn't have the greatest record with investments, acquisitions and joint ventures. 
In the early 1980s, IBM gave up on a joint venture with MCA Inc. that reportedly spent $100 million on the videodisk business. 
A major venture with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. was disbanded three years ago. 
Another venture, Satellite Business Systems, failed to go anywhere, and when IBM traded its holding for a stake in MCI Communications Corp., that didn't produce any synergies, either. 
More recently, IBM has been unwinding its purchase of Rolm Corp. 

   In addition, IBM's size can smother small companies. 
Some have said that IBM employees visiting them can at times outnumber their own employees. 
Interleaf Inc., which has a marketing arrangement with IBM, said earlier this year that its IBM product had been a money loser and that IBM needed to market it harder. 

   "I see a lot of activity but I don't see a lot of leadership in this area," says Fred Gibbons, chairman of Software Publishing Corp., which has held talks with IBM on various possible relationships. 

   Still, IBM seems to have learned from some of its earlier mistakes. 
It seems to have patched up its differences with Interleaf, for instance, and companies that IBM has bought into say the giant has gone to great lengths to shield them from its formidable bureaucracy. 

   "What impressed me is that we dealt with one person through the whole process," says David Sarna, chief executive of Image Business Systems Corp., an image-processing software company that recently sold a stake to IBM. 
"And within general guidelines, he seemed to have complete authority to act," Mr. Sarna adds. 

   He says that IBM executives "are feeling their way, just like we are." 
But he says they moved surprisingly fast, completing the agreement in 10 weeks. 
He also says that while IBM, under a previous marketing arrangement, paid its salesmen only for the IBM equipment they sold, it agreed to pay commissions on sales of Image Business Systems software, too. 

   "If you say IBM is buying loyalty, that's a true statement," Mr. Sarna says. 
"But it works both ways." 

   IBM is so big and has so many people arranging so many deals that there is still plenty of room for confusion. 
Doug Kahn, chief executive of Interactive Images Inc., a maker of software-development tools, says a glitch developed the day before he was to sign his agreement with IBM. 
He says IBM had an overlapping arrangement with another software company, and that the two companies got conflicting information from inside IBM. Mr. Kahn says several executives from his company got on a conference call with executives from IBM and the other company at 4 p.m. and didn't finish until 3:30 a.m. 
Some of Interactive Images' vice presidents then stuck around to type up changes to the contract, and Mr. Kahn didn't see the final contract until he arrived at an IBM office later that morning to sign it. 

   Mr. Kahn says he has a full-time person keeping track of what goes on inside IBM. 
"There are many, many different organizations inside IBM that have different agendas, and we have to make sure that we stay visible inside IBM," he says. 
Still, he says he's been impressed with IBM's ability to move fast and shield him from its complexity. 

   While IBM's investments have been all over the lot-in fiber-optic technology, data-retrieval systems, computer networks and so on -- the Policy Management investment illustrates IBM's considerable interest in developing expertise in various industries. 
Sam Albert, a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y., says IBM once sold its own software for the insurance market, but that it was rendered obsolete, so this is a way for IBM to renew its commitment to the area. 

   The Policy Management investment also shows IBM's willingness to make bigger investments than it has made in this recent wave. 
The dollar value is greater than that of any other investment that IBM has disclosed. 
The size of the holding -- preferred stock convertible into a 19.8% stake, plus the right to buy a further 10.2% in the open market -- is also one of the largest that IBM has bought. 

   Besides all the software investments, IBM has been active on other fronts as it pursues its aim of generating more than 50% of its revenue from software and services by the early 1990s. 
IBM has been emphasizing systems integration, a fast-growing field in which consultants set up whole computer systems for customers and often write the software used on them. 
As part of that, IBM has bought stakes in two companies -- Computer Task Group Inc. and American Management Systems Inc. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, IBM shares closed at $112.50, down 25 cents. 
In national over-the-counter trading, Policy Management shares rose 50 cents to close at $31.50.

   American Express Co. said second-quarter net income rose 16%, with strong earnings growth in most operations. 

   The travel and financial services company said net rose to $316.1 million, or 73 cents a share, from $272 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. 
The 1988 period included $12.4 million, or three cents a share, from the company's share of earnings of Fireman's Fund Corp., now being treated as a discontinued operation. 
Operating earnings rose 20%. 
Revenue rose 29% to $6.36 billion from $5.03 billion. 

   American Express's biggest unit, the Travel Related Services Co., had record profit of $214.2 million, up 17%, on a 24% revenue gain to $2.04 billion. 
American Express credit card usage continued to surge, with cards in force rising 13% to 33 million, including an 18% increase outside the U.S. Card charges rose 13% to a second-quarter record of $25 billion. 
Travelers check sales rose 4.8% to $6.3 billion, while travel product sales rose more than 10%, led by gains in the U.S., Asia-Pacific-Australia and in Latin America. 

   IDS Financial Services earnings rose 18% to a record $42.8 million, while assets owned or managed by the mutual fund and financial planning unit rose 16% to $43 billion. 
Revenue rose 22% to $463.1 million, and mutual fund sales rose 59% to $1 billion. 

   American Express Bank's profit rose 9.9% to $35.4 million although operating results, excluding less developed country debt activities, were essentially unchanged. 
The bank charged off $52 million of loans in the quarter, up from $42 million a year earlier. 
And it added $900,000 to its provision for credit losses, down from $3.5 million a year earlier. 
LDC loans totaled $739 million at June 30, down from $1.23 billion a year ago; the reserve for credit losses totaled $448 million, down from $678 million. 

   Information Services Co. profit rose 30% to $17.4 million in the quarter on $173.4 million in revenue, which rose 71%, reflecting internal growth and acquisitions. 
The unit had a pretax gain of $38 million from sale of its transportation and leisure cash advance business. 
Most of the gain was offset, however, by write-downs and by a $24 million reduction in pretax earnings and revenue in a change in accounting for profit of a health care-related business. 
The unit provides various services, including credit card processing, hospital information systems, mutual fund transfer and record keeping, and cable television subscriber billings. 

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., the brokerage concern, has reported a 43% gain in earnings. 
American Express' share of the net income was $34 million after preferred dividends, up from $23 million a year earlier. 
It holds a 60% interest in Shearson on a fully diluted basis. 

   John Keefe, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., called the results a "good quarter that fulfilled people's expectations of earnings growth. 
The numbers in the important divisions were very, very strong." 

   He said he expects the company to earn $2.70 a share for the year, "although with Shearson that needs to be bumped up a little bit." 
In 1988 the company earned $2.43 a share. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American Express closed yesterday at $35.50 a share, up 25 cents.

   The House, increasingly doubtful about the cost and strategic value of the radar-eluding Stealth bomber, voted to suspend production of the new airplane until the Bush administration agrees to deep cuts and a major revision of the $70 billion program. 

   The 257-160 bipartisan vote would force the administration, which lobbied hard against any cuts, to slash its request for 132 of the bombers -- also known as the B-2 -- and to demonstrate the aircraft's technical capabilities before production can resume. 

   In the face of sharp criticism of both the Air Force and Northrop Corp., the Los Angeles-based primary contractor for the B-2, the House also approved legislative language that would require extensive independent testing and unclassified cost studies prior to the start of full-bore production. 

   The hurdles that would be imposed by the House are significantly tougher than B-2 spending restrictions expected to be adopted by the Senate -- a disparity that sets the stage for a prolonged fight over the most expensive, controversial and closely guarded weapon currently in the pipeline. 

   "This issue crosses party lines and crosses philosophical lines," said Rep. John Rowland (R., Conn.). 
Before Congress agrees to spend $8 billion a year on the bat-shaped plane, he argued, "let's kick the wheels, let's fly it" and assess its ability to penetrate Soviet air defenses. 

   Members of both parties complained that the military kept basic information about the plane's cost and other matters classified for too long. 
"The Russians probably know more about this technology than this Congress," joked Rep. Arthur Ravenel (R., S.C.). 
A total of 49 Republicans voted in the majority to slow the B-2. 

   "There's no chance, no way we can go ahead with a program that is as costly" as the Pentagon's current B-2 projections, said Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), a co-sponsor of the successful amendment. 
The Pentagon currently estimates that the bombers will cost $530 million each, including research and development funds already expended. 

   The administration's military priorities received another setback when the House voted to temporarily block Pentagon moves to put MX nuclear missiles on railroad cars. 
President Bush asked Congress for money to deploy both the mobile MX and the smaller Midgetman missile, which is designed to be carried on special trailers. 

   As part of the $305-billion defense authorization bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, lawmakers approved an amendment offered by Rep. John Spratt (D., S.C.) removing $502 million earmarked to purchase railroad equipment and extra MX missiles. 
But the measure permits continued research and development for the so-called rail garrison program. 
The vote was 224-197. 

   The Defense Department's plan, the latest in a variety of schemes to field MX missiles, is to protect the 10-warhead missiles by moving them on the nation's rail system in time of crisis, making it impossible for an enemy to target. 
House Democratic aides said they expect Congress will approve funds for both the mobile MX and the smaller Midgetman once differences between House and Senate bills are worked out. 

   The House bill would cut about $1 billion from the Pentagon's request of $4.7 billion for the B-2 for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. 
It would provide enough funds to produce just four of the bombers over the next two years, instead of eight as the administration requested. 
More important, none of the production money could be spent unless Congress and the White House agree on a scaled-down program with leaner production rates and revised plans for the bomber's strategic use. 

   Rep. Ike Skelton (D., Mo.) asserted that gutting the B-2 program effectively would take the Air Force "out of the bomber business" after the year 2000 and undercut U.S. arms-control negotiators. 

   But critics blame the Pentagon for wanting to build the most-expensive airplane in history without defining a clear-cut mission. 
"The plane can't perform the mission for which it was built," said Rep. John Kasich (R., Ohio), urging lawmakers to kill the B-2 outright and mothball the production line. 

   Before the current debate, proponents primarily touted the B-2's ability to go after mobile missiles and other movable targets. 
But Pentagon officials now concede it won't be able to perform that mission for the foreseeable future. 
In the past few weeks, Air Force and administration officials have emphasized instead the plane's versatility, saying it could destroy everything from underground Soviet military command posts to tactical targets and even foreign terrorist groups. 

   In Los Angeles, Northrop officials played up the House's decision to reject an amendment offered by Rep. Kasich and others to kill the B-2 altogether. 
A company spokesman said that both the House and Senate "seem to be focusing on the value of the weapons system" and are strugggling "to come up with the best plan to keep {production} at an efficient rate." 

   Still, the House action was a major setback for the defense contractor, which has sunk more than $1 billion of its own money into developing the Stealth. 
One Northrop executive noted that the company has prepared to turn out 24 to 36 bombers a year. 
Assembling less than three a year, he suggested, would begin "to erode the team of people working on the plane" and reduce production efficiencies. 

   Northrop's management and its public relation efforts on behalf of the plane also rankled lawmakers. 
The company has "miserably failed to manage this program," Rep. Mike Synar (D., Okla.) said. 
Another critic, Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.), said she was offended and "astounded by the amount of money Northrop is spending on advertising."

<HL> Hooker Corp. Avoids Fight With Creditors
@  As Provisional Liquidator Takes Reins

   Ailing Australian property developer Hooker Corp. turned itself over to a court-appointed provisional liquidator, avoiding a protracted confrontation with its bank creditors. 

   Hooker, whose major retailing and real-estate operations in the U.S. include Bonwit Teller and B. Altman &amp; Co., asked the Supreme Court of New South Wales to appoint John Harkness "to take charge of the company." 
Mr. Harkness heads the receivership, reconstructions and insolvency division of accounting firm Peat Marwick Hungerfords in Sydney. 

   In a statement, Hooker directors said they believe their "prompt action" of relinquishing control to a court-appointed agent "will resolve the impasse with the banks and is therefore in the best interests of employees, creditors and shareholders." 

   The Sydney company's rift with its major bank creditors surfaced Tuesday when a group of banks terminated an agreement signed earlier this month. 
The accord called for 42 of Hooker's bank creditors to maintain their current level of credit lines to Hooker for four months ending in October. 
During that time, Hooker was to make interest payments on about $900 million Australian (US$676 million) in loans that aren't secured by specific assets and wouldn't have to repay principal payments falling due. 

   U.S. retail sources close to Hooker said the appointment of a provisional liquidator may speed the sale of the company's U.S. assets. 
"It's possible now that Bonwit Teller and B. Altman &amp; Co. will be sold separately rather than as a package together with Hooker's retail malls," said one source. 

   But Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo Inc., an investment banking firm that is providing financial advisory service to Hooker, said the appointment of Mr. Harkness as provisional liquidator is good news for Hooker shareholders and lenders because Mr. Harkness may be able to raise additional capital and retain assets. 
"A fire sale wouldn't be appropriate now," said Mr. Harrison. 

   Meanwhile, Hooker's sagging fortunes have prompted Robert Sakowitz, president and chief executive of Sakowitz Inc., a Houston retailer, to actively search for investment capital to acquire Hooker's 80% stake in his company. 
"We don't want to be tarred by the problems affecting Bonwit Teller and B. Altman," said Mr. Sakowitz. 
"Our company is completely separate." 

   As provisional liquidator, Mr. Harkness said his first task will be to "assess the financial position of the company and to recommend the best possible action to be followed in maintaining the worth of the company's assets." 
A provisional liquidator, with creditor approval, can either restructure or liquidate assets and distribute proceeds to creditors. 

   Some bankers in Australia are optimistic that Mr. Harkness can salvage Hooker. 
Among other tactics, a court appointee can freeze debt repayments, including interest, thus improving a company's cash-flow position enabling it to operate. 

   Hooker shares closed yesterday on the Australian Stock Exchange at 25 Australian cents, down 11 cents. 
Early this year, the stock traded above A$2. 

   As of March 31, Hooker had total liabilities of A$1.92 billion. 
Of that, Australian and other international banks are owed A$1.6 billion. 
In addition to A$900 million in unsecured loans that were covered by the now-defunct debt accord, Hooker owes A$700 million that is secured against specific Hooker assets, mainly in the U.S. 

   Tensions increased between Hooker and its bank lenders over the past month and negotiations broke down Tuesday mainly over Hooker's need to quickly raise A$55 million in additional credit lines from a group of its biggest bank lenders.

@  Boeing Co. $200,000

   The Federal Aviation Administration proposed a $200,000 civil fine against Boeing Co.'s Boeing Commercial Airplanes unit for allegedly failing to report wiring problems in some of its jetliners "in an appropriate and timely manner." 

   In one instance, Royal Brunei Airlines reported to Boeing on Aug. 3, 1988, that a cargo compartment fire-extingishing system on a Boeing 757 jetliner had been miswired. 
On Oct. 18, 1988, Delta Air Lines reported finding a similar problem on a Boeing 757, according to the FAA. 

   The FAA contends that in both cases, "Boeing failed to transmit to FAA a report of these miswirings in an acceptable form until Jan. 4, 1989. 
It appears Boeing violated federal aviation regulations by not reporting to the agency within 24 hours after determining defects existed." 

   Boeing said the FAA's allegation is "unmerited and the threatened enforcement action is unfortunate and unnecessary." 
It added that it will "decline to offer the suggested $200,000 levy." 

   Boeing has 15 days to respond to the FAA's settlement offer or provide additional information concerning the alleged violations. 

   The aerospace concern asserts that it properly reported the problems to the FAA in a timely manner, and that Boeing was "responsive to the situation and acted aggressively in cooperation with the FAA to assure that any miswiring was found and corrected." 

   Boeing said that although there haven't been any failures of the fire-extinguishing systems in service, it has redesigned them at the suggestion of the FAA. 

   Boeing has been doing extra tests on the systems since first learning about numerous cases of faulty wiring and plumbing on its entire family of aircraft built after 1980. 

   As of this spring, 94 separate instances of flawed fire-control systems had come to light. 
Of these, 15 were identified in the engines or cargo compartments of the more than 200 757s in service.

   Lotus Development Corp. said it will start shipping 1-2-3 Release 2.2 today, weeks earlier than generally anticipated. 

   The software company, which ran into major delays upgrading its bestselling spreadsheet program, finally started shipping Release 3.0 last month. 
Release 2.2 is a less ambitious upgrade, designed for people with older IBM compatible personal computers with smaller memories than that needed for Release 3.0. 

   While Release 2.2 includes improved graphics and better database features, as does Release 3.0, it lacks the bigger program's three-dimensional abilities that let a user display a series of spreadsheets that can be consolidated. 

   Lotus officials generally expect Release 3.0 to outsell Release 2.0, but many analysts and software distributors think Release 2.2 will be more popular. 
Release 3.0 has earned favorable reviews in several computer industry publications, and consultants say corporate customers like the improvements. 

   Getting Release 2.2 out the door will help Lotus's credibility. 
It will also help its earnings, because 30 days after the shipment, it will stop offering free upgrades to buyers of Release 2.0.

@  Profit Rose 12%
@  In Second Quarter

   Du Pont Co. reported that second-quarter profit rose 12% with operating gains in all business segments except its strike-hurt coal operations. 

   The chemical company earned $714 million, or $3.02 a share, compared with $639 million, or $2.67 a share, a year earlier on more shares outstanding. 
Sales were $9.28 billion, up 11% from $8.34 billion. 

   Those results were in line with Wall Street estimates, after accounting for nonrecurring items in the latest and the year-earlier quarters. 

   "Everything was a little bit better than we expected, except coal" said Leslie Ravitz, a chemical-industry analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. 

   If not for the nonrecurring items, per-share earnings would have grown 35% in the second quarter, despite more signs that the economy is weakening. 
That would support Du Pont's contention that its change in business mix and its belt-tightening has left it less vulnerable to cyclical swings. 
Still, analysts expect the company's pace to slow in the second half. 

   Edgar Woolard Jr., Du Pont's chairman, acknowledged in a statement that the year's last half may be hurt by "a somewhat weaker U.S. economy and the stronger dollar." 
A stronger dollar reduces profit that the Wilmington, Del.-based company reports when translating overseas results into dollars. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Du Pont shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $115 a share. 

   In the latest quarter, the sharpest improvement came in industrial products, where profit soared 93% to $158 million. 
The segment was helped by strong results for white pigments, which are used as whiteners in paper, plastics and paints. 

   Du Pont has benefited from a pigments manufacturing process that satisfies tightening environmental regulation as well as from continuing strong demand. 
Some competitors have had to close plants or take on the expense of altering them. 

   In the fibers segment, profit rose 19% to $182 million, as higher volume and selling prices for most textile products more than offset higher raw material costs. 
And in Du Pont's diversified businesses segment, profit was $166 million, up 18%, mostly because of strong demand for agricultural products. 

   Du Pont's Consolidation Coal Co. confronted striking members of the United Mine Workers only toward the end of the second quarter. 
Although volumes and prices rose from year-earlier levels, so did costs for each unit of coal shipped because there remained fixed costs at the struck mines. 
Profit edged down 2% to $48 million. 
The miners struck in sympathy with workers at Pittston Co., which has refused to sign an industry labor contract. 

   Profit also fell at Du Pont's Conoco Inc. oil company, by 16% to $115 million, but only because of nonrecurring items. 
Operating profit climbed 66% on higher crude oil prices, refined product margins and natural gas volumes. 

   Likewise, the polymers business showed a 4.7% drop in profit to $142 million because the year-earlier quarter included a $28 million gain on technology sales. 
On an operating basis, however, the segment posted a 17% profit increase in strong markets for ethylene-based polymers, used in packaging, among other things, and for fluoropolymers, such as Teflon. 

   In the first half, net increased 18% to $1.45 billion, or $6.10 a share, from $1.23 billion, or $5.12 a share, a year earlier. 
After the exclusion of nonrecurring items, per-share earnings climbed 30%. 
Sales were $17.95 billion, up 11% from $16.2 billion.

@  Airlines Win Federal Support

   In the ongoing turf battle over who has the right to regulate advertising -- the federal government or the states? -- score one for the federal government. 

   Over the past few months, state attorneys general have been cracking down on advertising they consider misleading. 
California and Texas have been especially aggressive, with both focusing on airline advertising and demanding that advertised air fares include all charges, not just a base price. 
The states contend that low advertised prices are too often misleading because they don't add in all charges. 

   But yesterday, the Department of Transportation aimed a slap straight in the face of the state attorneys general. 
The DOT proposed amending its rules to specifically allow certain charges to be listed separately from the base ticket price. 
In a statement, DOT said the "changes would reflect the Department's longstanding enforcement policy." 
And it said ads with separate charges wouldn't be "unfair or deceptive. . . . 
The Department's experience indicates that these types of ads do not cause passengers harm." 

   Advertisers, naturally enough, welcomed the move. 
The attorneys general "went way too far to protect the marketplace for consumers, and we're pleased that the DOT acknowledges that fact," said Daniel Jaffe, an executive vice president with the Association of National Advertisers, a trade group. 

   But the state attorneys general were quick to lash out at the proposal and they vowed to fight back. 
"In this act, the DOT has in essence thrown down the gauntlet," fumed Steve Gardner, an assistant state attorney general for Texas. 

   Indeed, the DOT's proposal is just the latest salvo in an increasingly pitched battle between the federal government and the state attorneys general. 
The National Association of Attorneys General has proposed strict rules regulating rental-car advertising as well as airline ads. 
Advertisers, and increasingly the federal government, contend that the attorneys general have no right to regulate national advertising. 
They contend the attorneys general are usurping federal authority. 

   Advertisers also insist that if states are allowed to regulate advertising, a resulting patchwork of different rules in different states would make national ad campaigns impossible. 
"If you want to have a national economy, then you have to have national regulation or you get economic chaos," contends Mr. Jaffe. 

   And in fact, the attorneys general have been reined in lately. 
A Texas court earlier this year temporarily banned the state attorney general from regulating airline advertising. 
What's more, Texas's Mr. Gardner says the attorneys general are feeling the heat from the food and automotive industries, both of which are also chafing at state attempts at regulation. 

   "I was very hopeful that President Bush would herald a change in the attitude we saw in the Reagan administration," which favored a laissez-faire stance when it came to regulating advertising, Mr. Gardner says. 
But instead, the Bush administration is "carrying on with business as usual . . . not giving a whit to the rights of consumers," he contends. 
He says he would file suit against the DOT if its proposal becomes a rule. 

   The attorneys general are especially infuriated because DOT made its proposal in response to a request for a ruling by the Air Transport Association -- an airline trade association whose members would benefit from the proposal. 

   The states' attempts to crack down on airline advertising included a complaint filed in March by California's attorney general. 
The complaint cited a Trans World Airlines advertisement promoting "The Drop-everything fare: $219 London." 
Small print at the bottom of the ad made clear the round-trip purchase requirements and additional fees; given the restrictions, the attorney general said, the cheapest price for the package would actually be $461. 
A TWA spokesman says the ad "is not deceptive," and adds that the ad clearly states the price is based on a round-trip purchase. 

   Such advertising, if the department's proposal is adopted, would apparently be fair play. 
"The advertising of a fare that is not being sold is a deceptive practice," protests M. Howard Wayne, deputy attorney general in California. 
"If the DOT has acquiesced in that, I don't believe they're acting in the interests of the consuming public."

   Hasbro Toy Accounts 

   Hasbro Inc. awarded the ad accounts for toy assignments -- worth $15 million to $20 million -- to ad agency Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor, New York. 

   Jordan McGrath emerged the victor in two separate reviews, one for a girls' toy assignment and one for a number of board games in the firm's Milton Bradley Co. division. 
Executives indicated Jordan McGrath's track record with Tonka Corp., an account it serviced from 1982 until May of this year, was a credential that played in its favor. 

   Other agencies competing for the girls' toy assignment included Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, Boston, and D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, St. Louis. 
Scali, McCabe, Sloves, New York, a unit of WPP Group, was the only other contender for the Milton Bradley assignments. 

   The accounts were previously handled at Griffin Bacal, the New York shop that is Hasbro's only other agency, servicing more than $120 million of its ad business. 
A spokesman for Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro said the decision to hire Jordan McGrath wasn't a reflection on its principal agency, but simply that it wanted to add an agency to service its burgeoning games businesses.

   McDonald &amp; Co. Investments said its board approved the continuation of an open-market securities-repurchase program. 

   Under the program, initiated in July 1987 and set to expire Monday, the company purchased 427,600 shares of common stock and $2,025,000 principal amount of its 8% convertible subordinated debentures due March 1, 2011. 
The company has also purchased 359,790 shares in a tender offer which expired March 3. 

   The extension authorizes the investment company to buy as many as 100,000 shares of common stock and up to $1,000,000 principal amount of the outstanding debentures, depending on market conditions and subject to regulatory restrictions. 
The authorization expires July 31, 1990.

   Next Tuesday when all self-respecting Europeans should be starting their monthlong vacations, top officials of the European Community's Commission will be convening a 23-nation meeting to work out a two-year program of food aid to Poland and Hungary. 

   This meeting is a remarkable example of Europe's new activism. 
For one thing, it is a political exercise being carried out by the normally apolitical European Commission. 
For another, it is taking place just two weeks after the seven-nation economic summit in Paris asked the EC to organize the food program on behalf of the industrialized world. 
"Europe doesn't have a government, but the commission is being asked to do more and more things governments do," said an elated commission official after the summit. 
The commission has recently proposed setting up a European Environment Agency, is writing a European Charter of Fundamental Social Rights, and has the task of representing EC member states at GATT trade negotiations. 
When it discusses possible quotas for U.S. television shows being broadcast on European airwaves, Hollywood and Washington shudder. 

   "It's like a tree," says another commission official. 
"At first you can see the trunk shoot up, and now the roots and branches are extending in all directions very fast, anchoring it solidly." 

   That the EC's bureaucrats are branching so fast into previously forbidden areas is the latest startling indication of how quickly Europe is getting its economic and political acts together. 
As the aid to Eastern Europe is being organized other bureaucrats will meet to work on plans leading to a single European currency managed by a system of central banks similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve System. 

   Although this is much more controversial than food aid to Poland, even the French are giving up some of their summer holiday to push things along. 
As chairmen of the EC's decision making Council of Ministers for the second half of this year, the French are stepping on the gas on monetary union, which they favor. 
They hope to have a workable plan by September and gain provisional endorsement at a summit meeting in Strasbourg in December. 
Next July, when a previously approved law goes into effect freeing the movement of capital throughout the EC, the French will call a treaty-amending conference to implement monetary union. 
This would mean real movement toward common European economic policy-making by the end of 1992. 

   That of course, is the date by which the EC's other bold plan, to abolish most inter-European barriers to the movement of people, money, goods and services, is supposed to be completed. 
Progress on this, too, has been faster than most Europeans had forecast. 
The commission has written more than 80% of the directives needed to bring down the barriers, and the Council of Ministers, the representatives of all 12 member countries who make the real decisions, have approved more than half. 

   Some controversial matters remain unresolved, such as how to harmonize the rates of value-added tax, a sort of national sales tax, that currently range from zero to 38% according to the country and the goods sold. 
Governments of high-tax countries fear losing business to low-tax countries, but also fear cutting tax rates will cut government revenue. 
Governments of low-tax countries fear taking the unpopular step of raising rates. 
But even here a compromise looks likely soon, allowing for a fairly wide range of tax rates. 

   Businessmen have moved faster than anybody predicted. 
Mergers and strategic alliances abound. 
In certain key industries, such as food, the 1992 preparation game is nearly over. 
BSN S.A. of France, for instance, made a preemptive bid to snap up RJR-Nabisco Inc.'s European cookie businesses before rivals Nestle S.A. and Unilever Group could even sniff at them. 

   "There's no question now that 1992 is a major dynamic force, helped by the fact the world economy is healthy," says commission official Hubert Onidi. 
"We were a little lucky to have launched the drive for the single market in the middle of a world-wide boom." 

   The enthusiasm and imagination generated by the 1992 plan are carrying over into areas like common political initiatives and a common currency that aren't part of the 1992 plan. 
The recent EC summit in Madrid reached unanimous political agreement on such diverse political matters as condemning Chinese repression and supporting closer East-West relations. 

   "The perspective of 1992 has created a tremendous psychological change in every actor in the EC," says Raymond Barre, a former prime minister of France and former vice president of the European Commission. 
"Habits and structures are changing in ways unthinkable five years ago because everybody is talking about the single market." 
Mr. Barre, for instance, now thinks economic and monetary union, EC jargon for common decision making leading to a common currency, is possible within 10 years. 
That's still not a view held by everybody in Europe, especially not British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
She supports the barrier-reducing single market plan, but thinks anything else -- like a single currency -- is unnecessary, would mean too much transfer of power from national governments to Brussels bureaucrats, and would distract attention from finishing the single market program. 
Nonetheless, the psychological pressure of 1992 has swept Mrs. Thatcher along into the process; she'll show up at the meetings on monetary union with alternate plans and hope to convince everybody else. 

   What almost nobody is talking about yet is what specific political structures might be needed to run a United States of Europe. 
Commission President Jacques Delors frequently ducks the question as premature. 
Mrs. Thatcher is holding out for a "Europe of nations," or a loose confederation within which national governments would maintain most of their powers. 
Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing envisions a more-federal Europe, with a president of the Council of Ministers apppointed for a five-year term whose "cabinet" would be composed of ministers from national governments. 
Others see national ministers sitting in a sort of Senate that would share power with the elected European Parliament. 

   Says Pascal Lamy, Mr. Delors's chief of staff: "We are building a federal Europe though we're not sure exactly what it is. 
There is no precedent for this sort of non-hegemonic unification." 

   He adds: "We're putting up the walls and other bits and pieces of a house even though we don't have a blueprint for what it's supposed to look like when its done." 
And the walls are going up ahead of schedule.

<TEXT>
   At the Khomeinis', afternoon tea comes in a little glass, and Revolutionary Guards serve fruit on a plastic plate with a picture of two ducks on it. 

   Khadijeh, the 76-year-old widow of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, sits in a corner of a courtyard, its high walls draped in black crepe. 
Guests -- women only -- leave their shoes at the gate and approach the widow with their condolences. 
Smiling, she offers a gnarled hand or a cheek to be kissed, then gestures to each of perhaps 30 visitors to join her, squatting on rugs on the ground. 

   Female Guards, their khaki tunics emblazoned with the fist-and-rifle emblem of their corps, pass the sugar bowl and platters of melon and dates. 

   "I'm sorry we have received you so simply," Mrs. Khomeini has her interpreter say. 
"But all through my husband's life, he insisted on simplicity." 

   The Khomeini home is indeed modest. 
Set in a northern Tehran suburb called Jamaran (which opponents like to point out means "place of the snakes"), the family quarters are spartan, almost shabby. 
A boxy, two-story building houses, in addition to Khadijeh, her 53-year-old son Ahmad and his wife and children. (Khadijeh's three daughters have their own homes but visit often. 
An older son died.) In one room, the thin mats used to sleep on are rolled up in a corner. 
A torn fly-screen dangles from a window; green paint flakes from the walls. 
In the kitchen, an old-fashioned stove and an electric samovar are the only appliances in evidence. 

   Off the courtyard, a striped curtain marks the passageway to the ayatollah's three-room suite -- bare but for a few books, a chair and a couch -- where he worked and slept. 
He joined the family to take his meals, stroll in the yard and watch television occasionally in the evening. 

   Even without the ayatollah, this little house remains a shrine. 
Weeks after his death, mourners still gather outside the house, weeping and praying. 
The balcony from which he greeted the faithful has had to be glassed in, so as to stop mourners who were clawing their way up to embrace his chair. 

   Mrs. Khomeini sometimes receives small groups of important women mourners. 
At such gatherings she, well-dressed, wears basic black. 
Only the grandchildren add a splash of color to the dark cluster of cone-shaped figures in their enveloping chadors. 
The children run about among the guests, oblivious to the eulogizing and occasional tearful outbursts. 

   "We have come to this place where the great imam used to breathe," sobs one of the guests. 
"We all have gathered here in this holy place to show our allegiance to his way." 

   Mrs. Khomeini nods her acknowledgment, wiping away an occasional tear. 
When her black veil slips a little, it reveals silver hair, which had apparently been colored with henna while her husband was alive. 
That isn't unusual among religious women in Iran. 
While they conceal their beauty in public, staying attractive for a husband is encouraged. 
In fact, plucked eyebrows are evidence that a woman is married. 

   A recent afternoon's guest list was a who's who of Iran's exported revolution: wives of the leaders of the Hezbollah or "Party of God," the most radical of Lebanon's Shiite factions; Turkish university students, visiting Tehran, who had been expelled from school for wearing Islamic veils; a South African Muslim who belongs to a radical, fundamentalist congregation whose key members are on trial for treason in South Africa. 
All had been invited to tea in Tehran because of their involvement in radical religion; they had been asked to come by the ayatollah's 48-year-old daughter, Zahra Mostafavi, for a two-day conference "to examine aspects of His Highness Imam Khomeini's personality." 

   The conference, featuring several meet-the-family get-togethers, appears to be part of a quiet post-mortem overhaul of the ayatollah's image, which is also getting some humanizing. 
Many pictures of him in public buildings nowadays show him hand-in-hand with a grandchild. 
One pose has him laughing as a toddler tries to push a forkful of food into his mouth. 

   Even more surprising to many Iranians has been the posthumous publication of his poetry. 
Among hard-line mullahs, verse of any kind is suspect. 
But the ayatollah's melodious, intricately rhymed poems are full of unexpected imagery, using, for instance, the intoxication of wine and the celebration of female beauty as metaphors for religious ecstasy. 

   Some Iranian academics and business people see a move to lessen the severity of the ayatollah's image as heralding some future relaxation of social strictures. 
The conference was apparently the brainchild of Mrs. Mostafavi. 
She teaches philosophy and heads the Iranian Women's Society. 
She has strongly endorsed Hashemi Rafsanjani's bid for the presidency. 
He, in turn, delivered the opening speech at the conference. 

   In that context, the family seemed eager to share all sorts of personal details about the ayatollah, ranging from how he wooed his bride to how he took his medicine toward the end of his life. 
Through the eyes of the women who lived with him, the West's bloodthirsty bete noire seems almost to be someone else. 
The man they see is a considerate husband, a caring father and a rather quirky old man, who was worried about germs and obsessive about punctuality. 

   "If I wanted to know the time, I would look at the imam rather than at the clock," says Fatima Tabatabai, the wife of his son Ahmad. 
"If he was reading Koran, I'd know it was 11:30. 
If he was taking a walk, I'd know it must be half past four." 

   The man who was to lead Iran didn't look like much of a catch to the wealthy parents of Khadijeh, when, as a 27-year-old theological student, he applied for her hand. 
His proposal might well have been rejected had the 16-year-old girl not had a dream in which the prophets appeared, praising her suitor. 

   Even so, moving from her affluent home into student penury was a wrench. 
"But he compensated her with his kindness," says Mrs. Mostafavi, who claims to have never heard her father ask his wife to bring him so much as a glass of water. 
And when their babies were born, he took his turn getting up in the night to feed them. 
Mrs. Mostafavi remembers just one argument between her parents -- over a rubber ball her mother bought for Ahmad. 
Her father didn't want the boy to have anything frivolous or distracting. 
Generally, though, the children were allowed to play as they liked, their father intruding only when he perceived physical or moral danger. 

   "If I wanted to play at a house, and he knew there was a boy there, he would say, 'Don't go there, play at home,'" Mrs. Mostafavi recalls. 
"You couldn't say, 'Come on, Dad, let me go,' because what he said was based on Islam, not on his own opinion." 

   The consequences of flouting Islam were made brutally clear. 
He once told Ahmad (according to Ahmad's wife): "I love you because you are obedient toward God. 
If you stand against God, I will stand against you, and if it is necessary according to the law, I will even send for your executioner." 

   He required frugality of his household. 
A Revolutionary Guard who has spent six years serving the family remembers him once noticing two pomegranate seeds that had fallen into the kitchen sink. 
"He wanted to know why we were wasting food," she says. 

   He was equally careful about cleanliness, wearing a specially made plastic and toweling bib at meals and using separate spoons to select pills from each of his medicine bottles, rather than taking out the tablets with his fingers. 

   Even with the ayatollah gone, the family still keeps to a strict schedule. 
The first note of the meuzzin's call to sunset prayer gives the signal that the tea party is over. 
Mrs. Khomeini, like her husband, prefers to pray as soon as the call comes, rather than waiting for a time as the law permits. 

   Reminiscing about the ayatollah, the family weeps a good deal -- disobeying him in that, if in little else. 

   His daughter-in-law Fatima recalls his words as he left the house for the hospital and the surgery from which he did not recover. 
"I'm going, and I'm not coming back," he told the family. 
"Don't cry for me. 
It is God's will."

   Two mid-sized Massachusetts bank-holding companies announced big losses, and blamed them on continued deterioration in the New England real-estate market. 

   1st American Bancorp, Boston, reported a second-quarter loss of $64.1 million, suspended its dividend, and said it is negotiating a "bulk sale" of its nonperforming real-estate assets. 

   The loss reflects its decision to add $72 million to its loss reserves, partly in anticipation of the asset sale. 
The bank-holding company had net income of $2.3 million, or 22 cents a share, a year ago. 

   1st American said its capital after the special provision is $61.7 million, or 10.02% of assets, including a $10 million tax benefit. 
Total assets on June 30 were $615.5 million. 1st American paid a dividend of 15 cents a share, most recently in June. 

   For the six months, 1st American posted a loss of $60.6 million, compared with profit of $5.6 million, or 53 cents a share in the year-ago period. 

   In national over-the-counter trading, 1st American closed at $3 a share, down 12.5 cents. 

   Separately, Comfed Bancorp, Lowell, Mass., posted a $3.7 million loss for its fiscal-first quarter, ended June 30, after a loan-loss provision of $3.5 million. 
In the year-ago quarter, Comfed had net income of $509,000, or six cents a share. 
The company has $1.7 billion in assets. 

   In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Comfed closed at $3.125 a share, up 12.5 cents.

   The Federal Communications Commission fined USAir and a subsidiary for deliberate interruptions of conversations between Philadelphia airport's control tower and pilots for Eastern Airlines. 

   The fines against USAir and Jetstream International Airlines were part of a joint enforcement effort by the FCC, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to eliminate intentional interference at several airports nationwide. 
Each airline was fined $2,000, according to the Associated Press. 
USAir is a unit of USAir Group Inc. based in Arlington, Va. 

   The illegal conversations pose a severe safety hazard, and the agencies have been alarmed by a flurry of jamming over the past two weeks, the FCC said. 

   A spokesman for USAir would say only that the company is conducting an internal investigation into the matter. 

   Most of the activity has occurred at the Philadelphia airport. 
In recent days, at least 20 conversations between the control tower and Eastern flights have been jammed or interrupted with harassing comments aimed at Eastern's pilots, said Jeffrey Young, an engineer in the enforcement division of the FCC's field operations bureau. 

   Pilots of Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp. have been on strike since March 4. 

   The agencies are analyzing tape recordings of the conversations, and the next step will be trying to match individual pilots with the illegal transmissions, Mr. Young said. 
Action against individuals will be up to the FAA and FBI. Interfering with airport communications carries hefty penalties. 
The maximum criminal penalty is a $250,000 fine and a jail term of 10 years, while the maximum civil fine is $2,000 per violation and revocation of FCC licenses.

   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. are finding a bonanza in the money management game, despite their belated arrival. 

   Two months after hiring a top money manager and some of his colleagues from rival First Boston Corp., fledgling Salomon Asset Management has already lured $400 million from institutional investors; it says it has agreements to manage nearly $1 billion more within the next 12 months. 

   And two months after Goldman decided to re-enter the business of managing stock portfolios, which it abandoned in the 1970s, Goldman Sachs Asset Management has already been offered a tidy $200 million from rich individuals, industry officials say. 
That's even though Goldman isn't going to actually accept any money for its new venture until Labor Day. 

   Goldman already manages $16 billion in money market and bond funds, a traditionally sleepy business for the firm; but it was the last big securities firm to stubbornly resist stock management. 

   Both Goldman and Salomon are "making the statement that {securities} sales and trading are going to be less profitable than they were in the past," says Michael F. Holland, chairman of Salomon Asset Management, who was hired away from First Boston in May. 
Salomon and Goldman are betting that money management is the wave of the future even though, as Goldman's top money manager Leon Cooperman concedes, it's "an overcrowded market with plenty of competition." 

   In some ways, the two big Wall Street firms are getting into the money-management game very late. 
The highly competitive money-management industry is showing signs of stagnating after 15 years of tremendous growth. 

   Already, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., after years of swallowing the money-management divisions of other firms, manages $105 billion. 
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc., one of the first Wall Street securities firms to plow into money management, has $30 billion in its Alliance Capital Management affiliate. 
And Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.'s 14-year-old money management operation has more than $25 billion; that doesn't include another $1.8 billion in leveraged buy-out funds. 

   For years, Salomon and Goldman resisted such forays out of fear of competing with big institutional clients who were money managers themselves. 
Some critics see a built-in conflict when Wall Street securities firms manage money; they claim that the firms' own traders could unfairly benefit by getting a first look at important stock research by the firms' analysts. 

   But the big securities firms are hard pressed for new ways to make money as they watch their traditional trading and brokerage revenues dry up. 
Potential money-management fees dwarf the diminishing commissions that Wall Street firms are getting from handling trades for others. 

   "These firms need asset-management products to sell to very wealthy people" and institutions, says Michael L. Goldstein, a securities-industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. Mr. Goldstein envisions Salomon sticking to a bond-oriented money management business, while Goldman establishes a presence on the stock side. 
Salomon is among the biggest bond trading firms. 
Goldman is known for its stock research and trading. 

   Mr. Goldstein sees the Wall Street firms using their new money-management operations as a springboard to other, highly sophisticated money-management products, like specialized bond portfolios, especially for foreign investors. 

   Scott Pierce, chairman of Prudential Asset Management Co. and former president of E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., is convinced Salomon and Goldman "will be successful" in money management. 
"I don't think we'll have too much come out of our hide, but there's no question the market is becoming more competitive." 
Prudential Asset Management, a unit of giant Prudential Insurance Co. of America, manages $90 billion for investors. 

   The demand for money management talent has recharged competitive juices among Wall Street firms. 
Despite the loss in May of its money-management team led by Mr. Holland, First Boston insists it didn't lose any accounts and "increased its assets under management to $7 billion from $5.2 billion since Michael left," says James L. Freeman, the new First Boston asset-management chief. 
Nevertheless, "Michael knew how to make the First Boston" sales, trading and research network work successfully in luring new money and managing it, Mr. Freeman says. 

   Mr. Cooperman -- who took over Goldman's money-management unit after 13 years as its highly regarded research director -- declines to comment on the industry estimate that $200 million has already been offered him by rich individuals. 
But he says Goldman has had "many inquiries" from potential investors, mostly individuals rather than institutions. 
"The feedback has been encouraging," Mr. Cooperman says. 

   Salomon hopes "to identify areas where there isn't huge competition and that play directly to our global resources," Mr. Holland says. 
"There is demand" for Salomon's traditional trading and research prowess in guiding clients attracted to such sophisticated investments as high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, mortgage-backed securities and highly specialized stock trading strategies, he says. 

   Nevertheless, the long-term picture is unclear. 
Salomon and Goldman may have done well initially in their new money-management ventures because they can tap into their big customer bases. 
But, some analysts say, the competition only seems to be increasing.

@  Talks on Capital-Gains Tax Compromise

   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski and top Bush administration officials are negotiating a compromise tax package that would include some sort of reduction in levies on capital gains. 

   The talks, if successful, would get President Bush and the House Democratic leaders out of a political jam. 
The two sides have been at loggerheads for a week over whether to give a preferential rate to capital gains. 

   That stalemate continues. 
But the fact that the negotiations are being held at all makes it increasingly likely that the House Ways and Means Committee will approve some sort of special tax treatment on the sale of capital assets. 

   President Bush has lobbied for, and so far won, a majority of votes on the committee for a reduction in the tax rate on capital gains. 
But the Democrats, led by House Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington state, and Rep. Rostenkowski of Illinois, have said such a cut is unacceptable because it would heavily favor the rich. 

   Now that they appear to be behind in the vote count, however, the speaker and Rep. Rostenkowski are offering up a more subtle change as a compromise. 
They are seeking to reduce gains on capital assets by indexing them to inflation before those gains are taxed. 
The indexing proposal is the centerpiece of a proposal that Rep. Rostenkowski has been discussing with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Budget Director Richard Darman. 

   The political stakes in the disagreement are high. 
This is the biggest initial test of the Foley speakership. 
But so far, the two sides haven't come to terms. 
According to Rep. Rostenkowski, the administration officials are still seeking a cut in the tax rate, probably through the use of a tax exclusion, while he is still pushing indexing. 
"We're all working toward the same goal. 
We all want harmony," Rep. Rostenkowski said yesterday. 
"What's keeping us apart is rates as opposed to indexing." 

   Rep. Rostenkowski, a Democrat, explained that administration officials have so far sought to give capital gains a preferential tax rate, much like a proposal advanced by Rep. Edgar Jenkins (D., Ga.). 
Mr. Rostenkowski added ominously, "I don't know that rates are even negotiable" for the House Democratic leadership. 

   Mr. Jenkins's plan, which is supported by the president, would allow individuals to exclude from taxation 30% of their gain from the sale or exchange of long-held assets from July 20, 1989, through Dec. 31, 1991. 
The exclusion would make the effective top rate on capital gains 19.6%, compared with the current top rate of as much as 33%. 
After 1991, the top effective tax rate wouldn't exceed 28%, and the assets would be indexed for inflation. 

   President Bush's proposal has a 45% exclusion, creating a top rate of 15%. 
The president's plan wouldn't cover real estate or timber; the Jenkins plan would. 

   Speaker Foley and Rep. Rostenkowski have sought essentially to replace the rate reduction with indexing. 
While it does lower taxes on capital gains, they see it as more equitable to lower-income taxpayers and more politically palatable to Democrats than introducing a special rate. 
Rep. Rostenkowski argued that the indexing idea is one "all can all claim victory on." 

   But he warned that so far the warring sides haven't accepted his reasoning. 
Some Democrats in the House, for example, oppose any type of capital-gains tax cut. 
"Everybody seems to be worried about saving face," he said. 

   For his part, Mr. Jenkins said he is open to "possible solutions to work out differences." 
But he expressed confidence that his proposal commands an unshakable majority in both the committee and on the House floor. 
"I'd like to vote. 
That's all I want," he said. 
"I'm interested in a completed project all the way through the process." 

   Rep. Rostenkowski said he doesn't intend to call for a vote on any capital-gains proposal until an agreement is reached or it is clear that one can't be. 
"It doesn't have to come up next week or even the week after," he said. 

   But some sort of special treatment for capital gains probably is in the wind. 
"Any compromise," Rep. Jenkins said, "would have to have something on capital gains."

<HL> Turn the Valdez Cleanup Over to Mother Nature

   After private, unannounced visits last week to a dozen Prince William Sound locations with a fisherman friend on his boat, I concluded that the value of the massive spill-cleanup effort lies primarily in public relations, not just for Exxon but also for Alaskan and federal officials and for Congress. 

   I have a special interest in these events, because as a member of the House Committee that wrote the Alaskan Pipeline Act in 1973, I heard Exxon and Alyeska officials maintain that there would never be a serious oil spill. 
But, they assured us, if a spill ever did occur, state-of-the-art technology would be ready to clean it up without serious damage to animals, fish or landscape. 
Their talk turned out to be cheap, but their overconfidence has cost a terrible sum. 

   An astonishing fact emerged from the House Interior Committee's hearings during our visit to Alaska two months ago: When the accident occurred, Alyeska and Exxon officials were not prepared to implement their contingency plans to clean up oil spills because they had believed the computers that told them such an accident could happen only once every 241 years. 

   Alyeska made no serious effort at containment even though for three days after the accident the weather kept most of the crude in the vicinity of the Valdez. 
Had Alyeska been able to implement its contingency plan, almost all of the spill could have been recovered within 72 hours, according to a study by the Alaskan Department of Environmental Conservation. 
Instead, Alyeska fiddled away the first three days, and then tossed responsibility off to Exxon. 

   The public was understandably infuriated by the spill, and officials -- company and government -- panicked. 
Whatever could be done, at whatever cost, was begun. 
This week Exxon estimated its costs at $1.28 billion, making the spill the world's most costly disaster. 
Three thousand cleanup workers, 7,000 support workers, 50 landing craft, 27 barges and many hundreds of other boats are involved. 

   What is all that money accomplishing? 
Not much. 
Worse, workers may be doing more harm than good to the fragile bays and beaches of Prince William Sound. 
The floating pools and puddles of oil I saw two months ago have been cleaned up. 
But during my quiet visits last week, the massive cleaning operations on rocks and beaches appeared to be reaping little return while causing significant environmental degradation. 

   On Eleanor Island I found nearly 500 men and women working at seemingly fruitless tasks: spraying rocks with hot water from high-pressure hoses without visible success and deploying high-tech skimmers that don't skim and supersuckers that don't suck. 
They were using some 35 boats and barges in previously serene Northwest Bay, which used to be disturbed only by an occasional fishing boat. 
Now the bay's abundant birds and other wildlife are buffeted by a massive, noisy 24-hour assault. 
Rocks and sand are gouged, dredged and rearranged, and each day's efforts result in recovery of only seven barrels of oil, probably less than that spilled by the flotilla of "rescue" boats -- and that doesn't even take into consideration the waste discharged by the 500 workers. 
The efforts are as ineffective as they are intrusive. 

   Similarly, a multi-million dollar operation on Perry Island, set up aboard several barges to respond to fishermen's complaints of oil-soaked kelp, has had little success. 
It had extracted only two barrels of oil from 25 pans of kelp in three weeks, and now sits idle because search crews can't find any more oily weed to process. 

   And Smith Island, which I first visited in early May, has been twice "treated" (Exxon no longer uses the term "cleaned") but looks just the same: It's still covered by oil-soaked rocks. 

   Exxon, which spent almost nothing to prepare for a spill, is spending enormous sums trying to clean up. 
All willing local fishermen have been hired to keep them busy (and quiet) and every known or inventable device has been brought or constructed to try to remove the oil. 
The crude, hand-made implements seem to work the best, according to one Exxon foreman at Gold Bug Beach, as he demonstrated how a piece of screen attached to a rake handle could lift oil out where an expensive skimmer failed. 

   The U.S. Coast Guard, which oversees Exxon's cleanup, continues to hold Exxon to a completion date of Sept. 15 and says it will call Exxon back early next spring if necessary. 

   I wish it were possible to remove the oil and return Prince William Sound and the beaches of three national parks to their former pristine condition, but the truth is that the technology to accomplish that task simply doesn't exist. 
We should therefore stop inflicting more pain on the environment. 
Nature should now be given the chance to finish the cleanup job, with only occasional help from small work crews where oil surfaces or puddles. 

   At the same time, we should demand some benefit from this ecological tragedy. 
Exxon and Alyeska, which are jointly responsible, should pay for every feasible study of the spill's impact on animal, fish and landscape, and for repairs and improvements, whenever they are possible. 
Under tort law principles, which set monetary values for pain and suffering inflicted on individuals, let there be a generous award for the pain and suffering inflicted on Alaska's beaches and animal life. 
Large "punitive damages" should be assessed as well, to make an example of the carelessness of Exxon and Alyeska, with funds earmarked to improve fish and wildlife opportunities and for future protection. 
Exxon -- and its equally culpable partners at Alyeska -- must remain liable for any short-term and long-term damages that yet become apparent. 

   And in the meantime, let's try to avoid future spills by studying other methods of containerization. 
It'll cost more, but this problem has become intolerable -- as recent spills in Lousiana, Rhode Island and Delaware prove -- and will only get worse.

   Shell Canada Ltd. and Husky Oil Ltd., a Nova Corp. of Alberta affiliate, filed rival plans with Alberta regulators to develop the estimated two trillion cubic feet of sour gas in the Caroline field for as much as 700 million Canadian dollars (US$580.2 million). 

   Shell, the Canadian affiliate of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and Husky disagree about whether to build a new gas processing plant immediately adjacent to the Caroline field, 74 miles northwest of Calgary, or to expand Husky's Ram River gas plant, 33 miles away. 

   "It's going to come down to a question of producer rights vs. the environmental benefits of not building another plant," said a Husky spokesman. 
The industry tends to support a majority owner's right to develop a gas field the way it wants. 

   Shell, which owns 62% of the Caroline field, plans to spend C$700 million to develop the field and build a new plant immediately adjacent to it, because significant amounts of liquids need to be removed daily from the gas, which has an unusually high sulfur content. 
Husky contends its C$640 million development plan, calling for expansion of its facilities and construction of a 33-mile-long pipeline to reach them, would be more economical and environmentally sound. 

   Alberta regulators are concerned about the rapid growth of new gas processing plants, and might not want another one, a Husky spokesman said. 

   All but one of the 12 other Caroline field gas producers support Shell's new-plant proposal and oppose the plan by Husky, which has a 12% operating interest. 

   Both parties expect provincial regulators to hold a competitive hearing this fall to determine which project will go ahead. 

   The Caroline field, one of Canada's richest finds in the past 20 years, was discovered in 1987.

   When it comes to managing mutual funds, one head is better than two. 

   That's the conclusion of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham, a Chicago investment adviser. 
Irked by the performance of some of its funds, Stein Roe has scuttled its habit of running funds by committee and now is relying on solo portfolio managers. 

   "Too many cooks spoil the stew -- especially in the investment game," says Michael Hirsch, chief investment officer of Republic National Bank of New York. 
"Very rarely does the committee system work." 

   The overwhelming majority of the nation's approximately 3,000 mutual funds are run by a single portfolio manager, a strategy sometimes known as the "star system." 
A handful of funds, such as Twentieth Century Investors, are successfully run by a team approach, with investment decisions made by several managers. 

   The major benefit of the committee approach is that funds rarely suffer when a manager leaves or changes strategy, as can occur with funds under the helm of a single captain. 
But critics contend that it's more effective to have one person calling the shots. 

   Performance was the driving factor in Stein Roe's decision, fund officials say. 
Stein Roe executives were unhappy with the returns of several funds, particularly the $200 million Stein-Roe Stock Fund. 
Although the fund has surged nearly 25% so far this year, its five-year performance barely matches the average of all general stock funds. 
The firm's equity funds typically have been solid bull-market funds but poor bear-market portfolios, industry executives say. 

   "The bottom line (of the switch) is to get better results," says Marshall Front, a Stein Roe partner. 

   Pay levels at Stein Roe also played a part. 
The firm's officials wanted to make it easier to link managers' compensation to performance. 
"To the extent you can do that, it motivates people better," Mr. Front says. 

   Stein Roe contends that the switch to single managers has gradually taken place over the past couple of years, even though on paper the funds have always been run by committee, which involved two or three managers. 
Stein Roe manages 16 funds with assets of $3.4 billion. 

   Separately, the firm recently shuffled several funds. 
It merged its Universe and Discovery portfolios, for instance, into its Capital Opportunities Fund to reduce expenses for some holders. 
And the company renamed its high-yield fund because it held relatively few junk bonds. 
The new name: SteinRoe Corporate Bond Fund-Investment Grade. 

   "Stein Roe has never been active in the junk market, and we didn't want the fund to represent itself that way," Mr. Front says.

   The junk bond market, after years of heady expansion, is bracing to lose what were considered its most promising customers: the nation's savings institutions. 

   The result could be slower growth for the $190 billion junk-bond market, where thrifts now own $15 billion of the high-yield, high-risk bonds, or about 8% of the total outstanding. 

   Junk bond traders found one bright note in an accord reached yesterday in Washington by the House and Senate negotiators responsible for drafting the savings-and-loan bailout plan: The conferees agreed to stretch to Aug. 1, 1994, the deadline for thrifts to shed their junk-bond holdings. 

   "The good news is that it's five years, instead of two years" as proposed earlier, before the thrifts will have to be rid of their junk bonds, says Amy K. Minella, a high-yield bond manager at Deltec Securities Corp. in New York. 

   Junk bond customers "aren't panicking," she says. 
Still, "the market has been dead in the water lately, and this {proposal} means it will continue to stay that way." 
Some of her thrift customers who wanted to get out of the junk market have been selling large portions of their portfolios for months; others are biding their time. 

   Only 5% of the nation's S&amp;Ls currently own the high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. 
But thrifts had been targeted by junk bond salesmen as a promising growth area. 

   "Their portion of the junk bond market was growing, and that made them important buyers," says David Aylward, executive director of Alliance for Capital Access, a trade group of junk bond issuers. 
Yesterday's accord in Washington "means that the market will not be able to expand as it otherwise would have been able to." 

   Regulators concede that junk bonds haven't been the cause of any failure of a savings-and-loan asssociation. 
But there's considerable debate in Washington over whether the government should allow large amounts of federally insured deposits to be invested in high-risk bonds. 

   One unusual aspect of yesterday's agreement allows thrifts to sell their junk bonds to separately capitalized affiliates, which wouldn't put government-insured deposits at risk. 
It's unclear how many thrifts would have the financial muscle or desire to launch such affiliates. 
But "Wall Street will be out trying to do it," one junk-bond analyst predicts. 

   The junk bond market this year has been queasy, reflecting the potential impact of a slowing economy on companies burdened with heavy debts. 
Prices of junk bonds, which are owned by mutual funds and many other instituions, have stagnated in recent months while prices of other bonds, especially Treasurys, soared. 

   In the long run, some thrifts' profit margins could come under pressure as they are cut off from a market that has outperformed most of their other investments. 
One report, published by the government's own General Accounting Office, found that between 1985 and 1987, returns on high-yield bonds in S&amp;L portfolios were second only to those on credit cards, and they ranked ahead of residential mortgages, commercial and consumer lending and Treasury and investment grade bonds. 

   Bond market analysts are divided over whether the Washington plan will prompt many thrifts to bail out of junk bonds right away or, instead, lead to divestitures over a long period. 

   Garrett Moran, manager of the high yield department at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, says a large percentage of the S&amp;Ls' junk holdings are in debt securities that will mature prior to the deadline or are likely to be redeemed by the issuer as interest rates continue to fall. 

   As a result, he estimates that the liquidations may amount to about $1 billion a year. 
"That's not too traumatic for a market the size of ours," he says, adding: "They won't have to sell in a distressed mode. 
It's a manageable problem." 

   But others aren't so sure. 
They note that legislators didn't address the question of whether thrifts would be forced to "mark to market" the value of their junk bonds to reflect current market prices -- a procedure that many financial institutions dread because it could reduce their earnings and their capital. 

   Under current accounting rules, thrifts that own bonds aren't required to mark them to market value as long as they have the ability and intention to hold those securities to maturity. 
However, if they are planning to sell the securities, their books are supposed to reflect current value. 

   If thrifts were forced to adopt mark-to-market accounting for junk bond investments, the thrifts could be hurt in two ways. 
First, a decline in the market value of junk securities could mean a charge against profit. 
Second, many thrifts probably would prefer to sell rather than hold securities that could have a widely fluctating effect on earnings -- which could lead many of them to dump junk bonds all at once, depressing prices and forcing S&amp;Ls to shed their bonds at a loss. 

   "It shouldn't be the cause of the legislation to impose hardships on institutions," says Alliance for Capital's Mr. Aylward, "but that concept seems to have gotten lost in the legislative process."

   The Food and Drug Administration authorized hospital-supervised use of an experimental drug designed to prevent respiratory distress syndrome, the leading cause of death and disability among premature babies. 

   The drug, made by Burroughs Wellcome Co. and called exosurf pediatric, has yet to receive marketing approval, but will be made available at about 600 hospitals through the FDA's investigational new drug application. 
Only 13 drugs, mostly related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, have been authorized in this way. 

   "When there is adequate evidence that a drug is effective and safe for a serious or life-threatening disease, and when no satisfactory alternative exists, we can make the drug available" in this way, said FDA Commissioner Frank Young. 

   Respiratory distress syndrome is a condition caused when the immature lungs of an infant aren't yet producing the coating that prevents lungs from collapsing. 
Each year in the U.S., 250,000 babies are born prematurely, and 50,000 of them have the lung condition. 
About 5,000 die from the syndrome annually. 

   Hospitals that have state-of-the-art prenatal facilities for infants and for mothers will be able to administer the drug. 
Until marketing approval is granted, the drug will be provided free of charge. 

   Burroughs Wellcome, the U.S. unit of Wellcome PLC, London, hasn't yet set a price for the drug, and said it is too early to determine what kind of impact it will have on the drug market. 

   The drug has been in the clinical testing stage since 1986, but use in hospitals could speed up marketing approval, an FDA spokesperson said. 

   Wellcome said the drug has proved effective in reducing death rates from the syndrome in three clinical trials involving 2,000 infants. 
But in a study of 350 infants followed from at least nine months of age, the therapy hasn't yet proved effective at reducing handicaps or other complications associated with premature birth, the company said. 
Further study is necessary to make conclusions about the long-term outcome after the use of exosurf. 

   According to the FDA, the drug will be made available for preventive treatment immediately after birth of infants weighing 1.5 to 2.5 pounds and for infants weighing more than 1.5 pounds who have already developed the syndrome and weren't treated right after birth.

   The dollar weakened after evidence accumulated that the Federal Reserve has eased its credit stance again. 

   Defying market expectations, the Fed failed to drain reserves from the banking system, allowing the federal-funds rate to slide to 8 7/8% by late in the New York afternoon. 
Fed funds have traded around a 9 1/4% middling rate since the Fed nudged the rate a quarter-point lower in early July. 

   "What we think we know now is that the Fed has eased its foot off the brake some more," said Frank Watson, vice president and head of corporate foreign-exchange trading at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. 

   Traders said it is still hazy whether the Fed has trimmed the fed-funds rate's middling range to 9 1/8% or 9%. 
For the past two days, trading in the funds has been volatile because of the end of a two-week bank-settlement period. 
The fed-funds rate is applied to money that banks lend each other overnight. 

   But by early today, the extent of the apparent Fed easing should become clear, traders said, and the removal of uncertainty may help support the dollar modestly, as participants collect profits on short-dollar positions taken when the first signs of easing surfaced. 

   In late-afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8675 marks, down from 1.8830 marks Tuesday, and at 140.02 yen, down from 141.45 yen. 
The pound was at $1.6590, compared with $1.6380. 

   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar opened for trading at 139.35 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 141.43 yen. 

   The early July fed-fund easing represented the first time the Fed had moved toward a more accommodative credit policy since early 1988. 
To control building inflationary pressures, the Fed initiated a program of interest-rate increases in the summer of 1987, but it relaxed credit for several months following the market crash in October 1987. 

   Higher interest rates usually boost returns on investments denominated in the domestic currency, helping to keep demand for the currency high. 
Lower interest rates can depress demand for the unit. 

   Although the market anticipated further easing by the Fed following a series of major indicators that place the U.S. economy firmly in a slowing pattern and comments by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggesting that the central bank's attention has shifted to avoiding a recession, yesterday's move still surprised many traders because it was earlier than expected. 

   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose $1.20 to settle at $374.90 an ounce. 
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.4 million ounces. 

   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $374.10 an ounce.

   Richard J. Matteis figures the best way to lead is by example. 

   So, in his first three days as head of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.'s new information and transaction services group, dubbed Geoserve, Mr. Matteis made five sales calls to prospective customers. 

   Mr. Matteis, a kinetic, intense 52-year-old who plays five hours of doubles tennis on weekends, is sending a clear message to his staff: Sell. 

   In banking, where careers typically aren't penalized for saying no to customers, such thinking runs contrary to the usual wait-for-the-customers-to-come-to-you attitude. 

   That's especially true for the unglamourous businesses that Mr. Matteis oversees: cash management, corporate and institutional trust, funds transfer, global custody and trade services. 

   Historically, banks made their money on the interest margins of their commercial loans and provided Geoserve-type services primarily to cement the relationship with the buyer. 
Little thought was given to them as significant sources of earnings. 

   But with commercial loan margins under pressure, banks are re-examining the earnings potential of these services. 
One sign of this is Geoserve's identity as a distinct business line -- just like retail banking and investment and commercial banking -- in the continuing restructuring of Manufacturers, the nation's seventh-largest banking company. 

   "We're taking people in what had been regarded as cost centers and are now saying you're a profit center," says Mr. Matteis. 
"That's the challenge: to get a sales culture going. 
I'm going to be spending a lot of time on sales." 

   Mr. Matteis, who joined Manufacturers six years ago after 11 years at Citicorp, will need to do some hustling himself if he is to meet the ambitious goals that he has set for Geoserve. 
This year, Geoserve is expected to generate a pretax return of about 15%, or $60 million on $420 million in revenue. 
His goal is to boost Geoserve's return to 20% next year and to 25% in 1991 -- all the while keeping costs about flat. 

   If he can do so, it will be impressive. 
The field of competitors in several of Geoserve's lines of business, such as electronic funds transfer, is fierce and margins are under pressure. 
Moreover, Manufacturers is behind some of its competitors, including Chase Manhattan Corp., American Express Co., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Security Pacific Corp., in reorganizing these ancillary services into a unified line of business. 
But Mr. Matteis says Manufacturers has an edge over competitors in several areas, and he foresees growth opportunities, such as global custody for investors' foreign securities. 

   James J. McDermott Jr., research director of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., said, "The ball is clearly in Matteis's court to show that Manufacturers can take this business and make it visible. 
If Manufacturers is to attract capital on a cost-efficient basis, they have to have a game plan. 
The creation and performance of this unit is an essential part of that game plan." 

   Given his energy, technical expertise and outgoing style, Mr. Matteis may pull it off. 
A physics major at Holy Cross College, he studied industrial administration at Yale University and needs only to complete a dissertation to get a Ph.D. in information services. 

   He spent seven years advising the Army on operations before becoming a consultant with Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton and Auerbach Associates. 
His consulting put him into contact with Citicorp, which he joined in 1972. 
There he was part of the team put together by John S. Reed, now chairman, who shared a car pool with him for several years. 
In the 1970s, the team made Citicorp's back office the envy of the banking industry. 

   Mr. Matteis's departure from Citicorp was similar to others' in recent years. 
With a comparatively young senior management at Citicorp (Mr. 
Reed recently turned 50), many ambitious executives faced a long wait before they could hope for a shot at one of the top jobs at the nation's biggest bank. 

   Instead, Mr. Matteis, who is married and has three daughters, joined Manufacturers as senior vice president in charge of the financial services group in 1983, where he spearheaded the development of its treasury management system for customers. 
Since then, he has been promoted to executive vice president. 
As general manager of Geoserve, Mr. Matteis will be one of a handful of Manufacturers' top executives when the reorganization is complete. 

   "The value that I add to the operation," Mr. Matteis said, "is the ability to relate comfortably with customers and the ability to deal with the technical issues."

   Investor Harold Simmons and companies he controls said they asked the Federal Trade Commission for clearance to buy as much as a 15% stake in Georgia Gulf Corp. 

   A spokesman for Mr. Simmons said the investor and his companies would like to increase their stake in the Atlanta chemicals concern to 10% to 15% of its shares for investment purposes. 
Federal antitrust laws require the company to seek FTC clearance to acquire 10% or more of a company's stock for investment. 

   If Mr. Simmons wanted to acquire the company, he would have had to seek FTC permission to acquire as much as $15 million in Georgia Gulf stock. 
However, he apparently didn't seek that approval. 

   Mr. Simmons, his 88%-owned Valhi Inc., and a company Valhi controls, NL Industries Inc., said they own 9.42% of Georgia Gulf's shares. 
According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group bought 272,900 shares between June 30 and yesterday at $37.625 to $38 each. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Georgia Gulf closed at $39, up 37.5 cents.

   The last vacant lot available for development in Hong Kong's central business district sold yesterday for 2.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$345.9 million), far below its estimated HK$5 billion value before the June 4 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. 

   The sale was viewed as an indicator of how the recent upheaval in China has influenced investor confidence in Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese control in 1997. 
The site's price works out to about HK$29,000 per square foot of land, or about 33% less than the value of the last major site sold by the government for commercial use, in January. 

   Nonetheless, analysts expect the news to have little impact on the Hong Kong stock exchange, whose capitalization is based largely on the value of real estate, because the price matched expectations. 
The local stock market already has declined about 30% since May 12, the day before student protesters started their hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. 

   The Hong Kong government announced after the close of stock trading yesterday that it awarded the 95,000-square-foot site to a subsidiary of Great Eagle Co. Officials at Great Eagle weren't immediately available for comment, but analysts said the company is planning to spend about HK$2.3 billion to build two office towers, the tallest to be approximately 50 stories, a public parking structure and a private parking area.

<DATELINE> EVANS ISLAND, Prince William Sound  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once a sanctuary for loons and kayakers, the rocky coves here are swarming with a noisy, mechanized army in yellow rain suits. 
One squad, 100 strong and armed with fire hoses, fans out across a 100-yard stretch of cobbled shore, attacking with plumes of water and jets of steam. 
Others do battle from barges, using huge nozzles mounted on booms to blast cascades of water at the cliffs. 

   They are fighting oil -- the stubborn residue of North Slope crude still clinging to hundreds of miles of beaches four months after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez precipitated the nation's worst spill. 
And Exxon Corp. as well as the workers is finding the oil an implacable enemy. 

   "Some beaches look pretty good after just a half a day" of cleaning, says Randy Vantine, the foreman of a crew of 20 working at another site on Eleanor Island, 20 miles to the north. 
"But in one place, we spent a month," he says, trying to rinse crude from a beach. 
All too often, he adds, the next tide flushes deeply imbedded crude from subsurface crannies and recoats cleaned beaches. 

   Exxon is clearly finding the mess its tanker left nightmarishly difficult to fix, a fact that led to its stunning disclosure Monday that it expects the cleanup costs to total $1.25 billion. 
And that's not counting potentially huge compensatory and punitive damage claims. 

   Lee Raymond, Exxon's president, declined in an interview yesterday to specify its initial cost estimate last May other than to say that "we didn't know very much then, but as time has gone by and things have evolved, the number wasn't out of bounds." 

   But Exxon must be dismayed. 
The new estimate far exceeds the Interior Department's $100 million projection soon after the spill and experts' later estimate that Exxon's bill, including litigation, would be at about $1 billion. 
It will be the costliest industrial accident on record, easily surpassing the $1.3 billion Three-Mile Island mishap and dwarfing the proposed $470 million Bhopal settlement. 

   Exxon's basic problem is the oil itself, which has proved extraordinarily persistent in the area's cold water and cool temperatures. 
Early on, experts hoped that the spill would be largely confined to Prince William Sound and would begin to dissipate naturally in 45 to 90 days. 
Instead, crude loosed on Bligh Reef, 25 miles south of Valdez, has migrated 470 miles to the southwest, wreaking havoc on seabird rookeries in the Gulf of Alaska, fishing grounds off Kodiak Island and remote beaches along the Alaska Peninsula. 

   More than half the 27,548 birds known to have been killed died in the Gulf of Alaska, where roaming patches of oil continue to plague beaches and kill sea otters and seals as well as birds. 
Winter storms may scour some exposed beaches of oil, but scientists fear that by next spring the spill's residue on huge swaths of sheltered beaches will be even more intractable, and expensive to treat, as it hardens to the consistency of asphalt. 

   "If things don't speed up, there'll be parking lots out there in some areas," says John Robinson, a science coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. 
"We'll need picks and shovels instead of water." 
Government officials agree that beaches reaching such a condition may linger for a decade or longer as aesthetic nightmares, unusable by humans and potentially dangerous to wildlife. 

   Mr. Raymond says the reoiling of beaches has been frustrating and concedes, "The oil has stayed with some beaches somewhat longer than I thought it would." 

   Nonetheless, Exxon remains sanguine about its ability to get most of the oil off beaches by Sept. 15, when the Gulf of Alaska's notoriously stormy winter weather will set in and make cleanup efforts even harder. 
"Assuming that we can have people working 'til mid-September {the pullout will be in stages}, we have a good shot at having all the beaches treated," Mr. Raymond says. 
"But not clean like Mr. Clean who shows up in your kitchen. 
Our objective is to make sure the ecosystems are back in shape." 

   Despite a pledge in May by Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl that the company would return next spring to clean up any leftover oil, O.R. Harrison, Exxon's spill manager, stirred up a tempest on Tuesday by saying Exxon will return to Alaska next spring with only a crew of 20 to survey the beaches, without committing itself to further cleanup work. 

   But in the interview yesterday, Mr. Raymond promised that Exxon would abide by the Coast Guard's determination next spring as to whether further work is needed. 
"It's our best guess that there will be a lot less oil than people think," Mr. Raymond says. 
"But if the conclusion is reached by the Coast Guard that something needs to be made right and it can be made right, we'll be there. 
We're not trying to run off." 

   However, Mr. Raymond declines to commit Exxon to restoring the beaches to their prior pristine state, although state and federal officials can, if they choose, enforce statutes requiring Exxon to try to do so. 
"I don't think Exxon is breaking its promise," he says. 
"Maybe people weren't listening. 
Back in May, Larry {Rawl} emphasized getting the toxicity out of the water and off the beaches so the ecosystems can again function. 

   "There are environmentalists who say that we want our beaches back to looking exactly like they did, but that could actually hurt the ecosystem. 
You'd have to dig it up or hit it with so much steam it would kill everything." 

   However, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper says, "Virtually from the beginning, Exxon promised Alaskans that the company would stay until the job was done. 
I expect them to fulfill the promise." 

   No one faults Exxon for lack of effort so far. 
It says it has already spent $600 million mounting what is, in effect, currently the nation's biggest public-works project. 
It has hired an army of 10,000 people, of which about a third are mopping up the beach. 
"It looks like D-Day," Mr. Raymond says. 
Most work 12-hour days in 14-day stints, collecting almost $17 an hour plus overtime. 
The company has marshaled an armada of 1,000 boats, including barges capable of housing 500 people, and a squadron of 70 aircraft. 

   Ballpark estimates indicate a price tag of $90 million a month just for the workers and boats, excluding a slew of other expenses, such as materials, transportation of workers and equipment, waste disposal and reimbursement of public agencies for their work. 
Although Exxon can recycle some of the oil hosed off beaches, the state is requiring it to ship tons of oil-soaked cleanup materials to a toxic waste dump in Oregon, on the ground that burning would unleash too many toxic pollutants. 
Exxon contends that this has slowed the cleanup and ballooned the cost. 

   In some areas of Prince William Sound, cleanup activities are so frenetic that bays sheltering workers have come to resemble floating military encampments. 
Skiffs turn inshore waters into busy highways. 
Some coves drone like busy municipal airports as helicopters and small planes ferry in supplies or wing off on reconnaissance missions. 

   But despite Exxon's epic effort, observers fret that the company is getting little bang for its buck and, even worse, may inadvertently be doing more harm than good in some areas. 

   Mr. Raymond says the vast majority of beaches haven't been reoiled, and the company claims to have so far "treated" about 140 miles of them -- a figure the state terms about 30% too high. 
However, John Lough, an Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation employee who tracks progress in daily flights over the sound, says, "I'd be hard pressed to say that there's a treated beach out there that hasn't been subject to some reoiling." 

   In addition, many fear increasingly that the most effective cleaning method -- high-pressure, hot-water washing -- may be doing more damage to the sound's near-shore environment than the oil on the beaches. 
That treatment wasn't chosen by Exxon: It was agreed on by state and federal experts after cold-water rinsing proved virtually useless against the weathered oil. 

   However, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration studies indicate that beach-blasting with water as hot as 140 degrees Fahrenheit is "cooking the intertidal zone," destroying organisms within 100 feet of the shoreline, eroding some beaches and building "sand dunes of oily material" that may pose long-term hazards to fish and wildlife, Mr. Robinson says. 

   Should continuing NOAA studies validate such fears, "we're going to quit washing early, and nobody's going to like that," says Vice Adm. Clyde E. Robbins, the Coast Guard's Valdez-based spill coordinator. 
Exxon says it believes that many of the problems of hot-water rinsing can be allayed by reducing the water temperature and exposure time of the beaches. 

   Nonetheless, Vice Adm. Robbins, NOAA and Exxon are trying desperately to persuade the state to allow the immediate use of an untried Exxon chemical dispersant on the weathered oil. 
Alaska balked, concerned about possible toxic effects on the summer salmon run and mindful of a political constituency skeptical of using any chemicals in the sound. 
But the state has agreed to expedite, though not waive, tests to determine the near-term toxicity of the chemical on salmon and other species. 
Those tests, which typically take a year or longer, are being telescoped into "a matter of days," though unfavorable results could prompt the state to reject use of the chemicals, says Steve Provant, Alaska's onscene spill coordinator. 

   Exxon is conducting the tests, and a final decision appears to be days away. 
Vice Adm. Robbins, who thinks the chemicals could dramatically hasten the cleanup, favors their use even though he sympathizes with the state's point of view. 

   The Exxon chemical is essentially a solvent -- kerosene stripped of its most toxic compounds and blended with detergent -- and undoubtedly is being prescribed for beaches only because of the oil's stubborn resistance to more conventional treatment, he adds. 
Unadulterated kerosene was used as a dispersant on a 1967 spill from the Torrey Canyon off the British coast, and scientists concluded it harmed the environment more than the spilled oil did. 

   The cleanup problems are exacerbated by the porous nature of the sound's rock and pebble beaches. 
State survey crews conducting test excavations of oiled beaches have found crude four feet deep in some places. 
Such beaches not only reoil themselves but sometimes unleash what state observers call slicks of "fugitive hydrocarbons" to soil other beaches. 

   Following a July 14 windstorm, so much oil had been loosed that DEC observer Erlene Blake says some areas "resembled the days right after the tanker went aground." 
Indeed, the intractable problem posed by roaming oil was obvious on a recent DEC overflight. 
Large stretches of beaches on Smith and Little Smith islands, which had been cleaned shortly after the March 24 spill, had been reoiled. 
And just off those islands, wide ribbons of mousselike oil, a quarter-mile long, lay poised to strike beaches with the next tide. 

   On the shores of Perry Island, a large rocky outcrop in the western sound, cleanup crews have successfully scoured oil off many moderately fouled beaches. 
Yet the scene is marred by sheens of oil floating nearby and by the glistening black surface of a large cape at Perry's southern edge that seems to have just been sloshed with fresh crude. 

   That scene is repeated over and over again. 
The beaches at Sleepy Bay, a salmon spawning area on the tip of Latouche Island in the southern sound, demonstrate how weathered oil resists cleanup. 
Exxon crews rinsed the beach several times but recently agreed to stop, and return later, because of concern that cleanup work would impede the salmon run, which has just started. 

   Yet a walk on the "treated" beaches of Sleepy Bay reveals that some portions of upper beach have already turned slab-like, with rocks welded together by encrusted crude. 
Near the tide line, the rocks are slippery from wet crude apparently welling up from below the beach. 

   Hoping to mitigate the damage to salmon that spawn in a stream coursing through a Sleepy Bay beach, Exxon got state permission to dredge up a 20-foot-wide swath of rocky stream bed and replace it with clean fill. 
Though it was supposed to gouge out only 18 inches of soiled rock, crews found that oil had saturated the stream bed as deep as three feet. 
They dug out the entire mess -- an act that the state says may have been harmful -- and rebuilt the bed with tons of new material. 
This ribbon of truly "clean" stream bed winding through blackened "treated" beaches indicates the draconian measures that some feel may be required if beaches are to be truly cleaned. 

   "It's not that Exxon is the Evil Empire in all this," DEC's Mr. Lough says. 
"It's just that so much of what's being done seems to do so little good. 
It's like Humpty Dumpty -- all the king's horses and all the king's men can't put these beaches back the way they were."

@  Affluent Women Are More Likely to Have
@  Caesareans Than Poor Are, Study Finds

<TEXT>
   Affluent women are about 75% more likely to give birth by Caesarean section than are poor women, a study found, providing evidence that financial factors contribute to what some believe is excessive use of the procedure. 

   "We tried to very carefully control for a variety of {clinical} factors that could account for this {finding}," said Jeffrey B. Gould, chairman of maternal and child health at the University of California at Berkeley and the principal author of the study in today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
"There is no ready medical explanation for why this should be so." 

   Nearly one in four infants in the U.S. are delivered by Caesarean section, and some health experts believe that as many as half of those procedures are unnecessary. 

   The study found that affluent women are 60% more likely to have complications at birth reported than are poor women. 
That may contribute to the higher rate of Caesareans among wealthier patients. 
But even when complications and other considerations are taken into account, the study found that women in families with incomes over $30,000 have a much higher rate of Caesarean births than those in households with incomes under $11,000. 

   The finding of more reports of complications among the affluent was surprising, the authors say, because wealthier women generally have better access to health care and would be expected to have fewer birth complications. 
One complication, a birth canal too narrow for the baby's head, was 2.5 times more prevalent among affluent women, yet health experts say no evidence exists to associate income with this anatomical condition. 

   Dr. Gould and his co-authors speculate that "differences in both health-care setting and clinical decision-making" contribute to the correlation between income and Caesarean rates, and that complications may have been overreported for affluent women or underreported for poor women. 

   "We don't know whether poor people are underserved or rich people are overserved," Dr. Gould said in an interview. 
He suggested a combination of financial and non-financial factors related to Caesarean births generally might help explain his group's findings. 
Reimbursement rates for the procedure may be higher than for vaginal birth, he said, and malpractice concerns may prompt doctors to resort to Caesarean section at the first hint of trouble. 
Otherwise, "your Monday morning quarterback may well be a lawyer," he said. 
Cultural influences from a doctor's training or practice may also figure in how a doctor decides what procedures to use. 
These are questions for further study, he said. 
Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Washington, D.C., consumer organization, said the Caesarean rate could be reduced if more women of any means gave birth at not-for-profit facilities or if hospitals developed conservative guidelines to discourage overuse of the procedure. 
Dr. Wolfe also said some doctors often list non-existent complications to justify doing the procedure, which is generally more lucrative for doctors and hospitals. 

   The consumer group's own broad study of Caesarean sections found, for instance, that some for-profit hospitals in California exceeded a 30% rate for Caesareans in 1986, while the rate at one not-for-profit health-maintenance organization was 19.4%. 

   "Women shouldn't have to bring themselves into poverty to lower their C-section rate," Dr. Wolfe said. 
"They should bring themselves into a better health-care system. 

   The Berkeley study analyzed birth-certificate data on 245,854 women in Los Angeles County in 1982 and 1983. 
The overall rate of Caesarean section was 17.8%. 
For women in families with incomes under $11,000, the rate was 13.2%, while it was 22.9% for women with family income over $30,000. 

   The study also found that 20.6% of nonHispanic white women of all incomes had Caesarean deliveries, while the rate was 18.9% for black women and 13.9% for Mexican-Americans.

   A psychiatrist was charged with unlawful trading in the stock of BankAmerica Corp. based on inside information he allegedly received from a patient. 

   The psychiatrist, Robert Howard Willis of New York, was indicted by a federal grand jury on 46 counts of securities and mail fraud. 
His lawyer denied the charges. 

   According to the indictment, Dr. Willis learned from a patient in early 1986 that Sanford I. Weill, the former chief executive officer of Shearson Loeb Rhodes, planned to attempt to become chief executive officer of BankAmerica and to invest additional capital in it. 
Shearson Loeb Rhodes was the predecessor of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 

   The patient, referred to in the indictment as "Jane Doe," knew of Mr. Weill's secret plan because her husband had "a business relationship" with Mr. Weill. 
"Had Weill been successful in his effort to become chief executive officer of BankAmerica, there would have been substantial upheavals in the personal lives of Jane Doe and her spouse," the indictment said. 

   The indictment said Jane Doe discussed Mr. Weill's plans with Dr. Willis "in a relationship of trust and confidence and in the context of their professional relationship" with Dr. Willis. 
Her discussions with Dr. Willis, 50 years old, occurred in January and February 1986, before Mr. Weill unveiled his plan to attempt to become BankAmerica's chief executive. 
The government contends the patient also disclosed to Dr. Willis that the plan called for Shearson to invest $1 billion in BankAmerica if Mr. Weill succeeded. 

   The indictment alleges that Dr. Willis purchased $171,130 of BankAmerica stock on the basis of the information he received from Jane Doe. 
He allegedly made a profit of $27,475 in less than 40 days by selling the securities after Mr. Weill disclosed his plan to the public. 

   Mr. Weill failed in his attempt to take control of BankAmerica. 
He is now chairman of Primerica Corp., the parent of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 

   Edward Brodsky, a New York attorney representing Dr. Willis, said Dr. Willis didn't violate the securities laws or any other laws or trade on inside information. 
"He's going to go to trial and I'm confident at the end he'll be found not guilty," Mr. Brodsky said. 
Dr. Willis is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges today.

   National Heritage Inc. said it will hold an annual meeting on Aug. 31, setting the stage for a bitter battle for control of this Southmark Corp. affiliate. 

   Southmark, which owns about 62.5% of National Heritage, recently told the company's management that it wants to name a majority of the directors to National Heritage's board. 
Southmark, which recently sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, says it wants to exercise its shareholder's right to have a board of its choosing. 

   However, National Heritage, a manager of nursing homes and retirement centers, has resisted, saying it wants to remain separate from Southmark's problems. 
Last week, it won a temporary restraining order preventing another Southmark unit from soliciting consents to name new directors. 
A hearing on that order is scheduled for today. 

   In response, Southmark yesterday asked an Atlanta judge to require National Heritage to hold a shareholders' meeting on Aug. 31. 
Although the affiliate said it decided Tuesday to have a meeting on that date, the judge ordered the meeting held and set a record date of yesterday. 

   Southmark said it will ask National Heritage's shareholders to change the company's bylaws to eliminate a staggered board and to name five of Southmark's current directors and an Atlanta businessman to the National Heritage board. 

   But Southmark will need some help from other holders: Its 66% stake was reduced to about 62.5% a few weeks ago when National Heritage issued about 800,000 stock options to 37 employees and provided loans to allow the employees to exercise the options.

   Only two of 13 people exposed to large doses of radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear accident survived after receiving bone-marrow transplants, indicating that such a procedure has limited benefits for victims of massive radiation exposure, according to an article in today's New England Journal of Medicine. 

   "Because large doses of radiation affect multiple systems," the authors said, even a successful bone-marrow transplant did "not necessarily ensure survival." 
The authors included Alexandr Baranov, of Moscow's Institute of Biophysics, and Robert Gale, a hematologist at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical School and a member of the team that performed the transplants. 

   Dr. Gale and his collaborators were careful not to infer that victims of a U.S. radiation accident would fare as poorly as the Russians did. 
Five of the 13 patients eventually succumbed to burns suffered in a major fire that resulted from the accident in the Soviet-designed graphite reactor in 1986. 
U.S.-designed reactors make such a fire highly unlikely. 

   At the same time, the article noted that, contrary to conventional thinking, a bone-marrow transplant apparently isn't risk-free because it can cause both a rejection reaction and interstitial pneumonia. 
At least two of the patients who died suffered from severe rejections, while three who died contracted the pneumonia. 

   Transplantation successfully stimulated blood-cell production in nine of the 13 patients, all of whom were men, ranging in age from 23 to 46. 
Ten of the donors were siblings, while three were parents. 

   Of the 11 who died, none lived longer than 2 1/2 months after his bone-marrow transplant. 
Both of the patients still alive more than three years after the accident are well, the article reported, although one still has burn-related problems and radiation-induced cataracts. 
The two survivors were 25 and 35 at the time of the accident and didn't have the serious burns that afflicted the others. 

   In an accompanying editorial, Christine K. Cassell and Jennifer Leaning, of the University of Chicago and Harvard University, respectively, said Dr. Gale's work "adds greatly to our knowledge of the management of acute radiation injury." 
The editorialists used Dr. Gale's article to criticize the U.S. Energy Department for having, until recently, allegedly covered up health and safety problems at U.S. nuclear weapons-manufacturing facilities.

   First City Bancorp of Texas said it fired its executive vice president and general counsel, Glen G. Magnuson Jr., after he admitted embezzling $18,484. 

   The bank holding company added, without elaborating, that "investigation has revealed other questionable practices" involving Mr. Magnuson and that "full restitution will be sought." 
A company official said the matter has been reported to bank regulatory officials. 

   Mr. Magnuson, who declined comment, was succeeded as general counsel by William G. Schopf, who will also remain as senior partner in the Chicago law firm Schopf &amp; Weiss, the company said. 

   First City said the embezzlement took place in March 1988, prior to a federally assisted bailout led by Chicago banker A. Robert Abboud. 
Mr. Magnuson joined First City in 1986, a spokesman said. 

   The company added that Mr. Magnuson "made misrepresentations in connection with obtaining employment at First City." 
It also declined to elaborate on this allegation. 
Mr. Magnuson also declined comment on the allegation.

   Cray Research Inc. shares fell $2.125 in heavy trading after the supercomputer maker slashed its revenue and earnings projections for the year. 

   The company, elaborating on its downward revision late Tuesday, cited a slowing economy that has delayed both government and commercial orders while fueling competition, particularly from International Business Machines Corp. and Convex Computer Corp. 

   "We're going through a difficult period of time," Cray's president, Marcello Gumucio, said in an interview. 
But he expressed optimism about Cray's long-term fortunes, adding, "This is one of the most solid companies in the world." 

   He also said the company is under increased internal pressure to produce a small machine, to compete in the $2 million-$2.5 million range. 
Currently, Cray systems are priced between about $5 million and $25 million. 

   As reported, Minneapolis-based Cray abandoned its forecast of a 10% revenue gain for the year and said achieving per-share earnings of $3.75 would be a challenge. 
For last year, Cray posted earnings of $4.99 a share. 

   Investor reaction to that disappointing news was strong. 
An order imbalance delayed Cray's opening on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, with early indications of a bid of $38 for the stock, which had closed Tuesday at $44.125. 
The initial trade was at $41.125. 
All told, 1.14 million shares changed hands. 
Cray closed at $42. 

   Mr. Gumucio seemed puzzled by the market's surprise. 
He said he had previously indicated "in the strongest possible words" to analysts and shareholders that "we had a challenging year." 
In the interview, he said revenue is under pressure because of lower-than-anticipated demand, and because of timing issues related to the transition to the new Y-MP supercomputer from its predecessor, the X-MP. 

   "We're also installing more used equipment than anticipated," he said. 
Not only does that mean lower revenue for Cray, but the company indicated that many first-time customers are preferring to lease machines rather than buy them. 
Also, Mr. Gumucio said the percentage of revenue from service and maintenance contracts is running higher than forecast, "and margins on service are lower than we had anticipated." 

   Cray's president wouldn't forecast earnings, either for the rest of this year or next. 
But analysts who talked with him earlier in the day said they felt the company had a "comfort level" this year of between $3.50 and $3.75 a share. 

   Several analysts said they were reluctant to make any forecast for 1990. 
"I haven't a clue. 
They gave no guidance," said Gary Smaby of Needham &amp; Co. 
But Barry Willman of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. said Cray indicated it expects some improvement in 1990 because of lower research and development costs, gross margin gains from volume shipments of Y-MP systems, and fewer trade-ins of old Cray hardware. 

   R&amp;D expenses this year are dependent on when Cray can spin off founder Seymour Cray's design unit, and its Cray-3 machine. 
The supercomputer is costing Cray Research about $10 million a quarter to complete and is over budget, Mr. Gumucio said. 
The spinoff is awaiting government approval as a tax-free transaction. 

   "We think the economy in the U.S. is going to be tough," Mr. Gumucio said in the interview. 
Noting that government purchases are under budgetary pressures, he said the company's commercial customers "in many ways depend on government spending -- universities, defense subcontractors and so forth." 
Big-ticket outlays by oil and automobile companies also are off, he said, although last month Cray announced lease orders from General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. for the company's big new machines. 

   Mr. Gumucio said Cray is encountering discount pricing by IBM, particularly in bidding for university contracts. 
Convex is being aggressive in battling for departmental-sized machines, at the low end of Cray's line. 

   While overseas sales remain strong, Mr. Gumucio said there is some preference for used and smaller new machines.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC, Minneapolis, said it sold the unit containing Steak and Ale and Bennigan's restaurant chains to an investor group that includes senior management of the unit for $434 million. 

   Grand Metropolitan, which acquired the S&amp;A Restaurant Corp. unit as part of its purchase of Pillsbury Co. last year, was obligated to dispose of the restaurants because state laws prevent a liquor distiller such as Grand Met from owning retail liquor outlets. 

   Dallas-based S&amp;A includes 159 Steak and Ale outlets in 24 states and 221 Bennigan's in 32 states.

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and Showtime Networks Inc. said they reached an "amicable resolution" on litigation involving the use of movies from Turner's MGM/UA Library. 
Terms weren't given. 

   In February, Turner asked for a ruling that its broadcast of certain of the films over its Turner Network Television, or TNT cable station, didn't violate Showtime's pact to show the same films. 

   The original suit, filed in federal court here, said Showtime had a "non-exclusive right" to exhibit as many as 800 films from the MGM/UA Library under an agreement reached with MGM/UA in 1985, before Turner bought MGM/UA in 1986. 

   Both parties expressed "satisfaction" with the resolution of the matter.

   Norfolk Southern Corp., Norfolk, Va., said second-quarter net income rose 9.8%, although earnings would have been about flat without a one-time gain. 

   Net rose to $173.7 million, or 99 cents a share, including a $13.6 million gain from the sale of holdings in Trailer Train Co., from year-earlier net of $158.2 million, or 87 cents a share. 
Revenue rose 5.4% to $1.17 billion from $1.11 billion. 

   The transportation company also raised its quarterly dividend on common stock to 36 cents from 33 cents a share, payable on Sept. 11 to stock of record Aug. 4. 

   Chairman Arnold McKinnon told securities analysts in New York that he expects traffic will be flat for the remainder of the year, reflecting the general slowing in industrial production in the economy.

   The Senate approved a nearly $11 billion natural resources bill incorporating major timber and oil provisions as well as sweeping requirements to force the disclosure of consultants and lobbyists hired to pursue federal funds. 

   Current restrictions on oil exploration in U.S. waters would be significantly expanded in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, and the measure includes precedent-setting language seeking to lift injunctions on timber harvests in the Pacific Northwest. 

   Final passage came last night on a simple voice vote, but only after daylong debate in which both oil and lumber interests suffered setbacks at the hands of environmental forces in the Democrat-controlled chamber. 
By a 72-27 margin, senators rejected an industry-backed amendment seeking to undermine the moratoriums on oil exploration, and timber allies failed on a 52-47 roll call to head off a $65 million cut from funding for new forest roads. 

   The Senate action came as the House Appropriations Committee approved a $27 billion transportation bill for fiscal 1990, and moved to interject itself in a renewed fight over military base closings. 
Congress authorized the Pentagon in April to begin shutting down all or part of 91 military installations next year, but the House committee yesterday amended a pending military construction bill to reopen the issue in as many as a dozen cases. 

   Facilities in San Francisco, Illinois and New Jersey would most likely be affected by the provision, which had the backing of the powerful defense subcommittee chairman, Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.). 
The amendment withholds any funds from being used to carry out the closings until cost studies by the General Accounting Office are completed, and the money would be released only if GAO finds the expected savings meet criteria set by an independent commission last year. 

   The Interior Department and Forest Service are among the major accounts funded in the Senate-passed bill, which anticipates an additional $460 million in fiscal 1990 for clean coal technology beyond the $10.9 billion counted in the measure itself. 

   Funding for the National Endowment for the Arts was only marginally reduced below the $171 million level approved by the House, but the Senate measure goes further in seeking to penalize those directly involved in awarding NEA money to support two recent exhibits criticized as sacrilegious and sexually explicit. 
The NEA would be prohibited from awarding any direct grants for the next five years to the two sponsors in North Carolina and Philadelphia, and Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) attached an amendment specifically prohibiting the use of any funds for exhibits of homoerotic art. 

   Though weaker on some points than the corresponding House bill, the Senate restrictions on offshore drilling cover the same 84 million acres of U.S. waters, including Alaska's Bristol Bay and much of the East and West Coasts. 

   Industry allies responded this week by attaching an amendment to prohibit oil tankers from entering these same waters if the moratoriums are still in effect in two years, and the goal was to put pressure on lawmakers to either relax the restrictions or see shipping obstructed in their home state ports. 
The industry also saw the provision as a means to highlight evidence that tankers pose more of an environmental risk than offshore rigs. 
But yesterday's vote to strip the amendment underscored how such policy distinctions are lost amid the emotions stirred by the string of spills since March when the Exxon Valdez ran aground. 

   Chief among the timber provisions in the bill are those seeking to force at least a temporary settlement between environmental and timber interests in Oregon and Washington states, where logging has been halted on tens of thousands of acres of federal land by lawsuits seeking to protect the northern spotted owl. 
The language, which has the backing of Speaker Thomas Foley in the House, would overturn current injunctions if no agreement is reached in the next two months. 
But environmentalists are assured of reduced cutting levels and language to protect old stands of timber favored by the owl. 

   Further refinements were added yesterday to ensure that the courts have a role in overseeing future forest sales. 
But timber interests themselves were on the defensive in the fight over road funds for the Forest Service nationally. 
The $65 million cut is a major blow in a chamber where Western interests have such sway, and the remaining $140 million is only slightly more than what has been approved by the House. 
The $27 billion transportation bill approved by the House committee yesterday would provide $11.87 billion in direct appropriations and an estimated $15.17 billion drawn from trust funds for highway and airport development. 
Funding for the Federal Aviation Administration would grow to $7.25 billion, including a 25% increase for facilities and equipment, and funds available for grants to airports would be increased to $1.5 billion-$150 million more than the Bush administration requested. 

   Amtrak, another budget target for the president, would be preserved at a $614 million funding level, but the federal subsidies for air carriers serving rural areas was reduced by $19.2 million, 60% below current levels. 
In a debate etched with bitterness, rural lawmakers angrily challenged the cut as too deep, but after first prevailing on a show of hands, they lost 26-25 in an effort to restore an estimated $9.3 million to the program. 

   The military construction bill -- which carries the new base-closing language -- allocated $8.7 billion to the Pentagon to construct and maintain facilities. 
The House committee yesterday approved a third spending bill appropriating $1.59 billion for Congress's own budget for the next fiscal year. 
Significant increases are provided for the offices of House leaders, but the more sensitive issue going into an election year was a nearly $81 million rise to cover mail sent out by both houses. 

   Separately, the legislative appropriations subcommittee quietly approved recently a $7 million reprogramming to carry out an expansion of the Capitol at the terrace level of the west front of the building. 
Another $9.8 million was previously reprogrammed last fall for improvements to the terrace area, and the funds will come from a major surplus left in the initial $49 million appropriation to restore the west front.

   A federal appeals court temporarily blocked a federal judge's order setting bail for Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi arms merchant. 

   The U.S. Attorney's office here had requested the stay, claiming that the judge's order didn't set conditions that would have ensured that Mr. Khashoggi would appear at trial. 
The government asked that Mr. Khashoggi not be released pending the trial. 

   On Tuesday, U.S. Judge John Keenan said Mr. Khashoggi could be released if he posted a $10 million bond and agreed to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, among other conditions. 

   After being extradited from Switzerland last week, Mr. Khashoggi pleaded innocent to charges of obstruction of justice and mail fraud. 
He has been accused of helping former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, hide assets that the Marcoses allegedly stole from the Philippines. 

   In its motion to the appeals court, the U.S. Attorney's office included a copy of a financial disclosure that it received from Mr. Khashoggi after the judge's order. 
That financial statement, which the government said hasn't been verified, puts Mr. Khashoggi's estimated net worth as of July 20 at $53.9 million. 

   The stay will last until the appeals court decides whether to revoke Judge Keenan's order, as the government has requested. 
The appeals court didn't say when it will decide that question. 

   Mr. Khashoggi's attorney, Robert Morvillo, couldn't be reached.

   Jiffy Lube International Inc. said it agreed to a plan that would restructure $75 million of its debt and give 80%-control of the company to Pennzoil Co. 

   Jiffy Lube, Baltimore, which operates and franchises automotive oil-change stations, said the plan would resolve debt problems by reducing debt, adding $35 million or more to stockholders' equity and providing a base for growth. 

   Under the plan, to be implemented within 60 days, Pennzoil, a Houston oil company, will convert its $15 million subordinated debentures and contribute $20 million in cash in exchange for new Jiffy Lube common, thereby acquiring an 80% interest in Jiffy Lube. 
Terms of Jiffy Lube's senior-debt payments would be significantly revised, allowing an overall reduction in future repayments of debt outstanding. 

   The restructured senior debt includes $35 million of senior unsecured notes at 12% a year, maturing over seven years, and a series of contingent notes with an aggregate face value of $29.4 million payable over seven years.

   National Education Corp. said it named J.W. Cwiertnia, 48 years old, as acting president and acting chief operating officer. 
It is the second top management change in as many weeks. 

   The company's board is expected to name Mr. Cwiertnia to the two posts on a permanent basis when it meets late next month. 
Mr. Cwiertnia was president of National Education, but resigned in March to seek a job as chief operating officer at another company. 
The post of chief operating officer at National Education is a new one. 

   After Mr. Cwiertnia's resignation, H. David Bright, who was chairman and chief executive officer, took on the additional post of acting president until resigning last week from all three jobs. 

   Mr. Bright was succeeded by David C. Jones, a director, who became chairman and acting chief executive. 

   National Education, a vocational and industrial training and educational publishing company, last week reported a second-quarter net loss of $1.5 million and said the results included a "much-higher-than-expected" $2.5 million expense because of an unusual problem with customer credits. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, National Education closed at $15.125 a share, up 12.5 cents.

   House and Senate negotiators on the huge savings-and-loan bill adopted steps to crack down on risky thrift investments, including a ban on investing in high-yield "junk" bonds. 

   As the House-Senate conference on the $166 billion legislation worked into the night, negotiators agreed to force thrifts to divest themselves of any non-investment grade bonds and direct equity investments within five years. 
S&amp;Ls could sell junk bonds to outside investors or to separately capitalized affiliates, while direct equity investments would be sold to outside investors. 

   These agreements are the latest in a series of provisions that toughen accounting regulations for S&amp;Ls and restrict their operations to more closely resemble those of national banks. 

   Yesterday's approval of the provisions, which were contained in a Senate compromise proposal, also was a victory for Senate conferees, who have conceded to their House counterparts on a long list of provisions. 
"We would like a few shreds of skin on our skeletons when we return to the Senate," said Sen. John Heinz (R., Pa.). 
Conferees said they expect to wrap up their work on the landmark bill this week. 

   The House-passed bill would have banned investment in junk bonds, while the Senate's would have maintained current law allowing junk bonds to constitute 11% of a thrift's portfolio. 

   Thrifts hold billions of dollars of junk bonds -- high-risk investments that as part of S&amp;L portfolios are backed by federal deposit insurance, and ultimately the taxpayer. 
Selling the junk bonds to outsiders or separately capitalized affiliates would insulate the federal insurance fund from the risk. 

   Although a recent General Accounting Office study determined that junk bonds have yet to contribute significantly to thrift failures, many economists predict that an economic downturn could topple thrifts with large holdings of junk bonds. 

   The biggest issue still to be determined is how the huge bailout package will be financed. 
When the conferees take up the issue today, the Senate will continue pushing the Bush administration's plan to raise $50 billion through industry bonds, with only the interest payments of more than $100 billion to be included on the federal budget. 

   The House would raise the cash with Treasury bonds, which would carry a lower interest rate but would require an exemption from the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
Administration officials this week said they would recommend a presidential veto if the conference rejects the Bush funding plan. 

   In deliberations yesterday, the conferees spent nearly an hour determining the future of one person: Danny Wall, the embattled chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
In the end, the House acquiesced to the Senate, preserving Mr. Wall's post as top thrift regulator and maintaining the revamped Bank Board's role as regulator of state-chartered S&amp;Ls. 
"These two issues are fundamental to our view of this bill," said Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. 

   The House bill would have substantially curtailed the thrift regulator's authority by transferring oversight of state-chartered thrifts to bank regulators. 
The House also would have required another Senate confirmation hearing for Mr. Wall, who has incurred lawmakers' wrath for underestimating the cost of the thrift crisis. 

   The negotiators also tentatively agreed that thrifts will have to maintain capital -- which serves as a cash cushion against losses -- equal to at least 1.5% of assets. 
Mortgage-servicing rights, contracts under which thrifts collect payments and otherwise administer mortgages originated by others, could count toward the 1.5% in proportions to be determined by federal regulators. 

   Under a compromise, the tougher capital standards would take effect four months after passage of the bill. 
Enforcement actions against thrifts that don't meet capital standards, such as limitations on growth, would be effective Jan. 1, 1991. 

   Conferees also adopted language raising to 70% from 60% the level of investments a thrift must maintain in mortgage-related assets in order to qualify for low-interest advances from the home loan bank system and tax breaks.

   TAX CREDITS ADVANCE, pushing minimum-wage measures to the background. 

   Talk grows in Congress about adopting an earned income tax credit for the working poor. 
After President Bush's veto of legislation to raise the minimum wage to $4.55 an hour from $3.35, "members feel they have to vote for something, and enacting the tax credit gives them a fallback," says Susan Cousins, a lobbyist with the Chamber of Commerce's Small Business Center. 

   Such action also would make compromise minimum-wage legislation less urgent. 
The main Democratic proposal by Rep. Austin Murphy, (D., Pa.), would raise the minimum wage only to $4.25 as Mr. Bush supports, but in two years instead of the three that the president wants. 
An alternative by William Goodling, (R., Pa.), would keep Mr. Bush's three-year wage proposal but cut use of his proposed lower training wage to four months from six months. 

   A slowing economy might further cool interest in minimum-wage action.

   SBA'S CHIEF BEGINS to focus on priorities and personnel at her agency. 

   One lobbyist asks about SBA Administrator Susan Engeleiter after her first three months: "What's she doing? 
She doesn't have an agenda." 
She counters that she is busy reviewing all SBA activities so "our programs don't offer an opportunity for another Wedtech" scandal. 
She will announce detailed priorities early next month. 
Meantime, she is expanding the SBA's influence: It will be included in working groups that report to the White House Domestic and Economic Policy Councils on such issues as tort reform and technology. 

   Ms. Engeleiter also has replaced some regional administrators and plans to name an associate deputy to oversee all financial programs. 
The latter prospect, some at the agency say, is a factor in plans by the respected head of the Office of Finance and Investment to retire after 21 years with the SBA. 
But the official, Edwin Holloway, 58, says he had planned to retire all along. 

   "We're still happy" with Ms. Engeleiter "and everybody I know says she's doing fine," says John Satagaj, Small Business Legislative Council president.

   ROSTENKOWSKI'S REVENGE? 
The National Federation of Independent Business says House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski is trying to punish the group. 
Its offense: pressing for repeal of the Section 89 employee-benefits tax provision instead of backing his compromise bill. 
"A committee staffer called and asked if we'd 'considered the consequences' of pushing for repeal," says lobbyist John Motley. 
A tax deduction for self-employed business owners then disappeared from the panel's budget bill. 
"We're not out to punish anybody; that's unfair and untrue," says a committee aide.

   HEALTH-BENEFITS ALTERNATIVE: Small-business groups are talking about a new bill being put together by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, (D., Mich.), that is expected to propose expanding health coverage without requiring employers to provide the insurance. 
It would be an alternative to Sen. Edward Kennedy's, (D., Mass.), mandated health-benefits bill, which small business strongly opposes.

   A PATENT PROPOSAL could hurt U.S. small businesses, some experts warn. 

   The Patent Office considers a rule to require applicants to disclose information that might result in denial of a patent. 
Small firms applaud the goal, but worry about other proposed requirements: Applicants would have to file the new data within three months of finding it or within three months of the original application. 
Otherwise, there would be fees for late disclosure. 

   Researching and filing new information is a technical process that often takes several months. 
That can be especially difficult and costly for small companies, says Washington patent attorney Barry Bretschneider. 
Another worry: U.S. companies will be at a disadvantage against foreign applicants. 
Because of an international treaty, foreign firms get some patent protection in the U.S. for a year after filing a patent abroad, giving them more time to research and disclose new information, Mr. Bretschneider says. 

   "We're just trying to encourage people to give us information as soon as they get it," says Charles Van Horn, the Patent Office's deputy solicitor.

   SMALL TALK: The Service Station Dealers of America estimates that the administration's clean-air proposal could cost its members up to $125,000 each and perhaps lead to "chaos in car care.". . . . 
SBA Chief Engeleiter, the mother of two, decides that the agency's new headquarters will include a day-care center. 
But her children, ages 2 and 6, won't attend.

   The U.S. and Japan provisionally agreed to add new chartered flights to serve their major cities, but remained far apart on the expansion of regularly scheduled air services between the two countries. 

   At the conclusion of three days of closed-door negotiations here, the State Department said another meeting has to be held -- probably in September or October -- to narrow these differences. 

   The U.S. has proposed a large expansion package, including seven new routes combining passenger and cargo services and two new all-cargo routes. 
Japan, claiming serious airport limitations, is offering three new routes, including one to haul cargo only. 
Carriers from both countries would serve any new routes. 

   Charles Angevine, the department's chief aviation negotiator, expressed hope that the two sides will bridge that gap. 
The U.S. has told the Japanese delegation that its position "isn't inflexible," he said. 
A Japanese spokesman said, "We have identified our differences and will proceed from there." 

   Currently, each country has 300 chartered flights annually to the other country. 
In addition to agreeing in principle to more chartered flights, Japan indicated that it could accommodate the U.S. in other areas, including an increase in scheduled services to Guam and Saipan and additional stopovers in Alaska by carriers of both countries, Mr. Angevine said. 

   This week's talks represented Washington's third attempt since last December to expand these trans-Pacific links. 
Several U.S. airlines are trying to break into this lucrative market or to gain additional rights, while an even larger number of U.S. cities are bidding to become new gateways to the Pacific.

   Energy Secretary James Watkins announced plans to develop a national energy strategy by December 1990 that is to be derived, in part, from an elaborate process of public hearings. 

   The plans to draft a comprehensive Bush administration energy policy came as the president signed a bill removing the last price controls on natural gas at the wellhead. 

   Mr. Watkins said there have been plenty of studies done in recent years but no "action plan" to put U.S. energy goals into effect. 
He promised to give a first draft to Congress by April, with final recommendations for adoption by Mr. Bush in December 1990. 

   The Bush administration's determination to draw up an energy policy contrasts with the Reagan administration, which was accused of not having one. 

   Mr. Watkins, a vocal advocate of nuclear power, said there is no preconceived focus, although he ruled out such devices as price controls in favor of free-market approaches. 
The plan is to address not only future problems, such as global warming, but current problems, such as rising U.S. oil imports. 

   The first hearings will be held in August and September in Tulsa, Okla.; Boise, Idaho; Seattle; and Louisville, Ky. 
In addition, the Energy Department will use scientists at its national laboratories to help draw up short-term, mid-term and long-term policy plans.

   Twelve states sued MasterCard International Inc. and Visa International Inc. alleging the companies violated antitrust laws in an effort to control the growing market in "debit cards" used by consumers to make retail purchases. 

   Point-of-sale debit cards can take the place of cash, credit cards, or checks by electronically transferring funds out of a consumer's bank account at the time of purchase. 

   The suit, filed in federal court in New York, involves a highly publicized 1987 joint venture begun by the two companies in 1987 to introduce the first nationwide debit card, called Entree. 

   The suit alleges that, as part of the joint venture, the companies agreed not to introduce their own separate systems to compete with Entree and to limit participation in the network to banks that are members of both credit-card associations. 
Non-banks with credit cards, such as American Express Co. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., are excluded from participating in the venture. 

   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams said the companies sought a stranglehold on the national debit-card market without actually putting the system in operation. 
The idea, he said, is to protect their own well-established credit cards from competition from other companies that might develop debit-card systems. 

   The suit charges that to prevent the entry of any other competitors, Visa acquired control of Plus Systems Inc., a national network of automated teller machines, and Interlink Network, the nation's largest regional debit-card network. 
Meanwhile, MasterCard acquired Cirrus System Inc., a national automated-teller network. 
Mr. Abrams said these acquired companies had been planning on entering the point-of-sale debit-card market before they were purchased. 

   A spokesman for Visa, based in San Mateo, Calif., said the company hadn't yet seen the suit and wouldn't comment. 
Robert Norton, general counsel for New Yorkbased MasterCard, said the company hadn't violated antitrust laws. 

   The suit claims that by February, more than 177 financial institutions had joined Entree and 1.4 million automated-teller cards had been issued with the Entree seal but that no merchants had been brought into the program. 
Thus, the cards could not be used. 
At the same time, the suit alleges, Visa and Mastercard continued to promote their own credit cards and ATM cards, which don't involve immediate electronic transfer of funds out of the consumer's bank account. 

   A MasterCard spokesman said the company has been a catalyst in the creation of a national network but that it is up to the banks to sign up merchants and market the concept to consumers. 
He said that when merchants perceive consumer interest they will be willing to make the economic investment required to install the machines in their stores. 

   The suit seeks to enjoin the Entree joint venture, compel the divestiture of Cirrus, Plus and Interlink, and assess civil penalties of up to $1 million for each violation. 
In New York alone, Visa and MasterCard each could face up to $10 million in penalties. 

   The two-year investigation that led to the filing of the suits grew out of an inquiry begun in 1987 when Visa President Charles Russell sent member banks a letter that some interpreted as a call to boycott American Express products. 
The letter was sent following the introduction of American Express's Optima card, which is designed to compete directly with Visa and Mastercard. 

   The Justice Department launched its own investigation concerning the letter but decided not to pursue any action, said a spokeswoman for the department. 
She said she couldn't comment on whether the department was investigating the Entree matter. 

   In a statement, Lawrence T. Kurlander, senior vice president of American Express Travel Related Services, Inc., said the company applauds the states' lawsuit. 
MasterCard and Visa "have pooled their extraordinary assets and resources in a manner designed to exclude American Express and others from potential markets, and thereby deprive consumers of the benefit of vigorous competition," Mr. Kurlander said. 

   James Shannon, attorney general of Massachusetts, said that in recent years the states have taken an active role in pursuing antitrust litigation because they have perceived it as not being vigorously pursued on the federal level. 

   Lloyd Constantine, chief of the antitrust bureau in the New York attorney general's office, said that prior to filing the suit, Visa and Mastercard were asked to abandon Entree but refused. 
"They're not doing anything to let anyone use Entree, but it's a significant barrier to anyone entering the market," said Mr. Constantine. 
"It's not dead. 
It's a half-breathing carcass."

   Compaq Computer Corp. posted a second-quarter earnings increase of 43%, despite analysts' projections of a softening personal-computer market. 

   The computer maker said net income rose to $83.9 million, or $1.96 a share, from $58.6 million, or $1.46 a share, a year earlier. 
Sales increased 58% to $722 million from $457 million. 

   In the first half, Compaq earned $167 million, or $3.92 a share, up from $105 million, or $2.67 a share, a year ago. 
Sales rose to $1.4 billion from $896 million. 

   Rod Canion, Compaq's president and chief executive officer, said he started the year believing the personal-computer market would grow 15% to 20% in 1989 and that sees no reason to change his prediction. 
"We're really not seeing the kinds of things people are talking about," he added, referring to some forecasts that market expansion has peaked. 

   Mr. Canion attributed the company's performance to demand for a recently introduced desktop computer based on a faster Intel microprocessor, the 386/33. 
In addition, foreign sales continued to boom, accounting for 44% of revenue and making Compaq the second-largest supplier of personal computers to the European business market. 
Compaq also started selling its computers in Chile, Venezuela and Colombia, new subsidiaries were established in Denmark and Norway, and the company is planning to nearly double its manufacturing capacity in Ireland. 

   Mr. Canion also said Compaq and other personal-computer makers who joined forces to provide an alternative PC design to challenge International Business Machines Corp.'s Micro Channel Architecture hope to introduce their first machines late this year. 
Then it will be up to the marketplace to decide "if either product delivers anything useful," he said. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Compaq shares fell $1.25 to $86.875 each.

   About 150 people turned out for what was billed as the first "open outcry" auction of bad credit card debt. 

   Between 30 and 40 bidders paid an average of 1.45 cents on the dollar for the $35 million in charged-off debt, said Tom Oliver, a vice president at Bank of America. 

   The lowest price paid for a package at the auction was a half cent on the dollar, while the highest price was about 4.25 cents, Mr. Oliver said. 
Auction results won't be official until Aug. 2. 

   While some packages went for less than expected, others went for more, leaving the BankAmerica Corp. unit satisfied with the results, Mr. Oliver said. 
Both he and auctioneer Ross Dove said representatives of other banks at the auction expressed interest in similar sales. 

   The auction was the subject of a recent Wall Street Journal article.

   Jury deliberations are set to begin today in the five-week racketeering and fraud trial of five former officials of Princeton/Newport Limited Partnership and a former trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 

   The government has accused the six defendants of conspiring to create illegitimate tax losses through a series of prearranged securities transactions. 
In these deals, Princeton/Newport allegedly sold securities at a loss and then repurchased them by prior agreement at the same or slightly higher prices. 
Such a practice is known as stock parking. 

   The jury must decide not only whether the defendants are guilty of cheating the government out of taxes, but whether they should be convicted of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO. 
The law carries heavy sentences and asset forfeitures upon conviction; it also allows for pretrial restraint of defendants' assets. 

   On trial are James Sutton Regan, the managing general partner of Princeton/Newport, and Jack Z. Rabinowitz, Charles M. Zarzecki and Paul A. Berkman, all of whom are general partners of the investment firm. 
Also on trial are Steven B. Smotrich, Princeton/Newport's comptroller, and Bruce Lee Newberg, a former Drexel junk-bond trader. 

   The government relied mostly on dozens of tape recordings of phone conversations between Princeton/Newport officials to present its case. 
Prosecutors also called several witnesses, including Frederick Joseph, Drexel's chief executive officer, and William Ward Hale, a former Princeton/Newport trader. 

   Among those testifying for the defense were Messrs. 
Regan and Smotrich, and Joseph Harch, a Drexel managing director who was called to testify on behalf of Mr. Newberg.

   Maxicare Health Plans Inc., which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, said it distributed to creditors a plan for its reorganization. 

   Maxicare said the proposals call for creditors to receive various amounts of cash, debt and equity securities -- suggesting a dilution of current common shareholders' stake. 

   The Los Angeles-based owner and operator of health maintenance organizations declined to disclose details of the proposals. 
Under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law, a company continues to operate with protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to repay debts. 

   One of the nation's largest health maintenance organizations, Maxicare filed for bankruptcy on March 15. 

   The proposed settlement terms would apply to debts incurred prior to the company's Chapter 11 filing. 
The company didn't say what settlement it plans to offer more recent creditors. 
A spokesman for Maxicare said that, for current obligations, "generally speaking, the company is paying on a current basis."

   Eastern Airlines unexpectedly withdrew its bankruptcy court request to break its labor contract with its pilots. 
The carrier asserted that its plea was designed to bring the pilots to the bargaining table but that the ploy had backfired. 

   When Eastern sought permission June 21 to abrogate the contract, the move was widely interpreted as its long-awaited first effort toward becoming a low-cost, non-union carrier like its sister company, Continental Airlines. 
Six years ago, Continental, also a unit of Texas Air Corp., used bankruptcy to abrogate its union contracts. 

   But yesterday, Eastern painted a different picture, maintaining that it filed the motion last month only because it "hoped to initiate a series of negotiations which would ultimately result in a prompt settlement" with its 3,500 striking pilots. 
It contended that it has belatedly discovered the filing "may be an impediment to resolving the dispute," because it made pilots reluctant to discuss any contract changes. 

   The pilots' union scoffed at Eastern's version of events, and hailed the withdrawal as "a major victory." 
Eastern dropped the request "only because it knew it would lose," contended a pilot spokesman. 
Several pilots involved in the matter said David R. Shapiro, the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner, had told them he would oppose Eastern's request to break the contract. 
Last night, Mr. Shapiro couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Whatever the case, withdrawal of the request is significant. 
Had Eastern pressed the issue and prevailed, it would have been free to impose unilaterally on its pilots new wages and benefits. 
It has sought more than $65 million in wage cuts and workrule concessions from them, and has argued that such savings are essential to its plan to slash costs and successfully reorganize. 

   Now, under airline labor law, the current contract between Eastern and the Air Line Pilots Association will remain in force even though the pact expired more than a year ago. 
Officially, the pilots are striking in sympathy with Eastern's machinists, not over their own contract. 
So, to resolve its pilot-labor issues, Eastern still faces the prospect of a lengthy negotiation procedure controlled by the National Mediation Board, rather than the potentially faster route through bankruptcy court. 

   Despite more than three weeks of continued negotiation since Eastern asked to end the contract, the sides reached an impasse last week and remain at a stalemate. 

   Cost savings weren't mentioned in Eastern's announcement yesterday. 
Airline officials say, however, that Eastern is achieving some of the savings it sought as it hires new pilots, who are paid at a sharply lower rate than previously hired pilots.

   Showboat Inc. posted second-quarter net income of $1.7 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $2.3 million a year earlier. 

   Revenue of the Las Vegas hotel-casino operator rose 16.5% to $87.2 million from $74.8 million, reflecting improved performance of the company's Atlantic City, N.J., facility. 

   Showboat's overall operating profit rose to $8.8 million from $3.3 million a year ago. 
Pre-tax earnings from Atlantic City operations grew to $11.4 million from $4.9 million, while revenue increased to $72.6 million from $61.8 million. 

   Operating profit from the company's Las Vegas operations fell to $1.6 million from $2.3 million a year ago.

   Conner Peripherals Inc. said it plans a public offering of 6.3 million shares. 

   It said it expects to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the next few days. 
The computer-products company currently has 36.2 million shares outstanding. 
A price range for the offering hasn't been determined, a spokesman said. 

   Conner said four million of the shares to be sold will be new. 
The remaining 2.3 milion shares will be sold by certain shareholders, including Compaq Computer Corp., which will sell one million of its 13.6 million Conner shares. 
Compaq's current holdings represent a 40% Conner stake. 

   Compaq, Houston, said it is selling the shares because it no longer considers having such a large equity stake in Conner vital for either company's development. 
It said it may lower its stake in Conner further in future years. 

   Conner said proceeds will be used for various capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. 

   In national over-the-counter trading, Conner closed at $10.625, off 37.5 cents. 

   Separately, Conner said second-quarter net income more than doubled, to $9.4 million, or 26 cents a share, on sales of $164 million. 
In the year-ago period, Conner had net of $4.4 million, or 13 cents a share, on sales of $50.1 million. 
For the six months, Conner earned $15.1 million, or 42 cents a share, on sales of $294.8 million. 
A year ago, it earned $7.7 million, or 24 cents a share, on sales of $92.7 million. 

   Conner, which makes disk drives for microcomputers and workstations, attributed its surging results to broad demand for its entire product line and to profit margins that improved because of cost-cutting, among other things.

@  Industrial Shares Advance 29.97,
@  Aided by Heavy Program Buying

   Heavy futures-related program buying caused the stock market to jump sharply. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 29.97 to 2613.05, erasing its losses earlier this week and setting another post-crash high. 
The rally also sent Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index and the New York Stock Exchange Composite beyond their former all-time highs, set in August 1987. 

   Technology stocks remained out of favor as weak second-quarter earnings reports from Cray Research and Amdahl, arriving on the heels of lower expectations for the personal-computer industry's growth, hurt the group. 

   On the other hand, the latest outburst of takeover speculation in media and airline stocks sent those sectors higher, and consumer-oriented issues -- the market's leaders throughout most of the year -- posted gains amid some well-received earnings reports. 

   While interest in those issues helped establish the market's direction after some indecisive early trading, it took buy programs related to stock-index arbitrage to send prices soaring. 

   The program buying was rooted in renewed optimism about the economic outlook, based on further evidence that the Federal Reserve had signaled an easing of its monetary policy and expectations that the report on the economy's second-quarter performance would point toward slower but sustained growth. 

   Gross national product figures for the quarter are expected to show that the economy expanded at a 2% annual rate, according to a consensus forecast of economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. 

   Against that backdrop, stock-index futures prices rallied to relatively large premiums to the cash indexes around 3 p.m. EDT and stayed there until minutes before the close. 
Traders capitalized on the advance by selling futures contracts and buying stocks. 

   The S&amp;P 500, whose previous all-time high was 336.77, easily exceeded that mark by rising 4.17 to 338.05. 
The New York Stock Exchange Composite gained 2.04 to 188.14; its best close ever had been 187.99. 
Also, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index jumped 3.60 to 316.97. 

   Despite a slowdown in trading activity at midafternoon as many investors set their sights on the GNP figures, Big Board volume climbed to 188,270,000 shares from 179.3 million Tuesday. 
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the Big Board by more than a 2-to-1 margin, with 981 issues rising and 483 falling. 

   The American Stock Exchange Index, which established all-time highs in six consecutive sessions earlier this month, also closed at a new peak. 

   The burst of confidence about the economy signaled a departure from the market's recent nervousness about the prospects for a "soft landing" -- moderate growth, lower rates and easing inflationary pressures. 

   "One day we're looking at recession, and the next day we're looking at inflation," said Joseph A. DeMarco, managing director for equity trading at the Marinvest unit of Marine Midland. 

   That uncertainty has helped preserve the market's focus on consumer stocks, as their earnings tend to hold steady even when economic growth slows, he said. 

   Consumer stocks benefited from reports of improved earnings at PepsiCo, which rose 1 1/2 to 59, and Anheuser-Busch, which added 1 3/8 to 44 3/8. 
PepsiCo's second-quarter results were better than analysts had expected; earnings at Anheuser-Busch met forecasts, and the company raised its dividend by 22%. 

   Elsewhere in the sector, Philip Morris climbed 6 3/8 to 157 7/8, American Brands rose 3 to 77 1/8, Procter &amp; Gamble added 1 3/4 to 119 1/8, Gerber Products jumped 4 3/4 to 89 5/8, Ralston Purina surged 4 to 99 1/2, CPC International climbed 2 to 69 1/8 and Colgate-Palmolive added 2 1/4 to 57 3/4. 

   The buying in the consumer sector pushed drug stocks sharply higher as well. 
Merck rose 1 7/8 to 75 5/8, Warner-Lambert soared 5 3/8 to 107, Squibb advanced 3 3/8 to 87 3/4, Rorer Group rallied 1 5/8 to 39 1/4, Eli Lilly jumped 2 7/8 to 62 5/8 and Pfizer rose 1 3/8 to 61 1/4. 

   Entertainment and media company stocks wrote a rally script of their own. 
Investors with a fondness for movies, magazines and television started spending the $7 billion they will be receiving from Time's purchase this week of 100 million Warner Communications shares at $70 each. 
Investors won't actually get the money until next Monday, but they can buy stocks with it now because the trades won't be settled until a week later. 

   Walt Disney jumped 5 3/8 to 109 3/4 on volume of more than 1.3 million shares. 
MCA, parent of Universal Pictures, rose 3 3/8 to 67. 
Although some traders cited rumors that either might become a target for Paramount Communications, which failed to win Time, analysts said antitrust problems probably would doom such a bid. 
Analysts also cited Disney's expected rapid earnings growth as a reason for investors to plow their Warner proceeds into Disney. 

   Other media stocks that rose included Tribune, which gained 2 1/2 to 60 1/4; McGraw-Hill, up 1 7/8 to 75 1/4; Time Warner, up 1 5/8 to 139 1/2; CBS, up 5 1/8 to 218 3/4; Capital Cities/ABC, up 9 to 514 1/2; Gannett, up 1 1/4 to 47 7/8; Knight Ridder, up 1 1/4 to 55; and Washington Post, up 2 1/4 to 291. 

   The takeover-driven gains among airline issues sent the Dow Jones Transportation Average up 13.59 to 1266.66, marking its third consecutive record close. 
AMR, which owns American Airlines, rose 1 7/8 to 68 5/8; Delta Air Lines gained 1 5/8 to 72 1/4, and USAir Group firmed 5/8 to 50. 

   Rumors of a possible restructuring sent Chrysler soaring 2 1/2 to 26 1/8. 

   Cummins Engine surged 2 1/2 to 60 1/4. 
Industrial Equity (Pacific), controlled by New Zealand investor Sir Ronald Brierley, disclosed that it holds a 9.9% stake in the company and plans to seek U.S. antitrust clearance to boost its holdings to 25%. 

   Knogo jumped 2 to 15 1/8 on the news that a group including Walter &amp; Edwin Schloss Associates, a New York investment partnership, holds a 5.21% stake. 

   Fischbach rose 5/8 to 25 1/8. 
The company accepted a takeover offer of $29.835 a share in cash from a group led by Asher Devere, a British investor. 

   Northrop, the prime contractor for the Stealth bomber, dropped 3/4 to 25. 
The House voted to halt production of the plane for one year in order for the Air Force to develop a cheaper, scaled-down development program. 

   The Amex Index climbed 2.66 to 372.78, topping the previous high of 372.40, set last Wednesday. 
Volume totaled 13,120,000 shares. 

   Sotheby's Holdings rose 1 5/8 to 24 1/4. 
The company reported that world-wide auction sales for the 1988-89 season rose 48% to a record $2.3 billion.

   Healthcare International Inc. said it expects to report a loss for its fiscal-fourth quarter ended June 30 compared with net income of $1.4 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. 

   Officials of the Austin, Texas, healthcare concern refused to estimate the size of the anticipated loss, but blamed the loss on increased competition in certain markets and start-up costs of new facilities. 

   The company also said it is facing cashflow problems that could affect its ability to make debt payments on leases and equipment and put it in technical violation of covenants in its loan agreements. 
It said it is in "substantive discussions" with others about selling assets or arranging interim financing to relieve the cash bind. 

   In addition, the company said that officers who earlier proposed acquiring the 73% of the company stock they don't already own haven't been able to get financing for the $22.5 million purchase.

   Texaco Inc. said second-quarter net income declined, reflecting the last year's restructuring and asset sales, while Occidental Petroleum Corp. posted a small increase and the Shell Oil Co. unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group had a large jump. 

   Crude-oil prices that were nearly $3 a barrel higher in the quarter compared with a year earlier contributed to operating gains at Texaco and Shell. 
All three reported robust profits from refined products. 
Toward the end of the quarter and in this month, however, the chemical and gasoline markets have weakened considerably and crude prices have declined, which could soften this quarter's results. 

   "We are encouraged by our record first-half performance," said Frank H. Richardson, Shell president, "but at the same time {Shell is} cautious with respect to the second-half outlook, given current trends." 

   TEXACO 

   Net fell 21% to $366 million, or $1.39 a share, from $464 million, or $1.91 a share, in the year-earlier quarter that included a gain of $225 million, or 92 cents a share, from the sale of its West German unit. 
Revenue for Texaco, which has shed many assets in a major restructuring, fell 8.9% to $8.45 billion from $9.28 billion. 

   Texaco, of White Plains, N.Y., said earnings from continuing operations rose more than 34% in the quarter. 
Texaco's operating profit from U.S. oil and natural-gas production more than doubled to $168 million. 
Foreign-production profit declined, largely because of loss of production from the explosion at the Piper Alpha platform in the North Sea last summer. 
Production was also lower because of the sale of Texaco's Canadian and German units. 

   Chemicals operating profit more than doubled to $88 million and refining and marketing profits also rose sharply. 
But such gains may not be repeated for a while. 
"End-of-quarter margins . . . reflected pressure from a softening of wholesale and retail gasoline prices," said James W. Kinnear, president and chief executive officer. 
He said chemicals margins also narrowed as the quarter ended. 

   OCCIDENTAL 

   Net rose 3.9% to $80 million from $77 million as sales rose 6.5% to $5.05 billion from $4.74 billion. 
Per-share net fell to 29 cents from 34 cents, reflecting an increase in the number of shares outstanding. 

   The bulk of Los Angeles-based Occidental's earnings come from its chemicals operations, in which operating profit rose 38% to $306 million. 
The period's results include a full quarter of Cain Chemical Inc.'s operations, acquired in May 1988. 
Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental, said, "We are enthusiastic about the continued strong results of our chemical division." 

   The company's oil and gas results plunged because of the absence of crudeoil production in the North Sea because of the accident at the Piper platform, where Occidental is the operator. 

   SHELL OIL 

   The Houston unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group said profit surged 61% to $440 million from $274 million. 
Revenue rose 8.7% to $5.87 billion from $5.4 billion. 
Strong margins accounted for record chemicals earnings of $186 million in the quarter, up from $133 million. 

   Shell's oil and gas production earnings nearly doubled to $168 million. 
The company said domestic-crude prices it received averaged $16.55 a barrel, the highest in nearly two years and up $2.93 from a year earlier. 
Refining and marketing profits were also up strongly.

   Electric Stimulation 

   Might Halt Bone Decay 

   BONE degeneration might be stopped or even reversed by electric stimulation, medical researchers at the University of Pennsylvania hope. 

   Osteoporosis afflicts many older women because of estrogen loss following menopause or a hysterectomy. 
Osteoporosis also can result from immobilization, such as when an arm or leg is in a cast. 
It even has been found in astronauts after prolonged space travel. 
The inactivity deprives bone of the physical stress necessary to stimulate its growth. 

   Carl Brighton, chairman of the orthopedics department, says four studies on lab rats have formed a "solid foundation" for experiments in humans, the first of which is slated for September. 
He said the studies grew out of his earlier work with electric stimulation to heal fractured bones. 

   The researchers induced spinal osteoporosis in rats by castrating them, the equivalent of menopause, and "disuse" osteoporosis in rats by immobilizing the bone between the knee and ankle. 

   Two to 4 1/2 months later, after the immobilized bones began to weaken, a mild electric current was applied to rats continuously for six to eight weeks. 
The weakened bones began to regenerate, reversing the osteoporosis. 

   In another set of experiments, electric stimulation prevented spinal osteoporosis when applied immediately after castration. 

   Dr. Brighton says that while evidence suggests electric stimulation starts to regenerate bone growth, no one has determined how it works at the cell level. 

   Hearing Loss Starts 

   Early in Farm Kids 

   THE HEARING LOSS commonly found among adult farmers may begin in childhood, says a report in the American Journal of Public Health. 
The study suggests that farm children should begin using ear plugs to try to minimize hearing loss. 

   In the study of 872 vocational agriculture students in central Wisconsin, researchers found that between 71% and 74% of the students, mostly boys, who lived and worked on a farm had some loss of hearing in at least one ear. 

   In contrast, only 46% of those who didn't have any exposure to farm machinery suffered some degree of hearing impairment. 

   The hearing loss was most evident at high frequencies, which the researchers from Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, Wis., attributed to farm machinery noise. 

   The left ear was most often affected among students living and working on the farm. 
This finding confirmed previous studies showing that a tractor driver's left ear is most exposed to engine noise because he observes his work by looking over his right shoulder. 

   The audiologists also measured sound levels of tractors and other farm implements and found that many emitted noise at levels above those set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
"It is important to note that these standards are primarily meant to apply to adults," the report said, suggesting that the high noise levels may be even more damaging to children. 

   Exotic Herb May Speed 

   Colon Cancer Detection 

   RESEARCHERS are studying a Central American plant that may help them detect colon cancer early. 

   University of Michigan researchers have isolated a new protein from the seeds of amaranthin, a purplish herb, that binds to colon cancer cells and premalignant tissues, which may eventually become malignant. 

   The researchers said the protein may help identify potential problems early and also may eliminate the need for more painful testing for some people who aren't at high risk of developing colon cancer. 

   "Long before a tissue becomes cancerous, it undergoes a number of changes, but no one is quite sure how to identify these tissues as precancerous," explains C. Richard Boland, associate professor of internal medicine. 

   In a study, the researchers took tissues from people with colon cancer, from people who were in the premalignant stage and from some patients with polyposis coli, a genetic disease characterized by widespread polyps in the colon that often turn malignant. 

   They stained tissues with the amaranthin protein and found that it adhered to all tissues with colon cancer, to 82% of premalignant tumors, to 83% of tissue with tumorous polyposis coli and to 60% of the non-tumorous type of polyposis coli. 

   The researchers hope to use the study to refine diagnosis of colon cancer. 
Currently, colon polyps and cancers are detected visually with a flexible scope inserted into the colon. 
But the colonoscopy usually cannot identify premalignant tissue. 
About 120,000 new cases of colon cancer are reported annually in the U.S., and about 60,000 people die from it. 

   The researchers said amaranthin could be in widespread use for detecting colon cancer within two years. 

   Infrared Rays Tell More Than Melon Squeezing 

   AN INFRARED device may tell whether a cantaloupe or watermelon is as sweet as it looks and smells. 

   U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists say the breadbox-size machine has tested 85% accurate in measuring the sugar content and ripeness of melons. 

   The device sends infrared light through the fruit, and a meter measures the amount of light absorbed. 
"The more infrared (light) absorbed, the sweeter the fruit," says Gerald G. Dull, a scientist at USDA's Agricultural Research Service. 

   The researchers say the machine, which is still being tested, could stop growers from mistakenly harvesting unripe melons and might be useful on other fruits and vegetables as well.

<HL> 'Yield-Curve Arbitrage' Rewards the Skillful

   When interest rates were rising last autumn, many Wall Street firms took a licking on their big bond portfolios. 

   But traders at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. turned the rising rates into a $20 million pot of gold through a little understood and often lucrative strategy that bond professionals call "yield-curve arbitrage." 

   The "yield curve" is a line that shows how yields differ on debt securities of different maturities -- ranging, for example, from three-month Treasury bills to 30-year Treasury bonds. 
Usually, short-term interest rates are lower than long-term rates, because investors want higher rates the longer they lend their money. 

   Arbitragers try to exploit changes in the yield curve, rather than making huge outright bets on where rates are headed. 
In a period of rising inflation, the yield curve steepens as long-term bond yields rise. 
In periods of falling inflation, the yield curve tends to flatten as longer rates fall. 

   This trading technique is becoming increasingly important for market-making power in the huge U.S. government bond business. 
A dealer who can ease a billion dollars of highly volatile long-term bonds into his own portfolio and hedge it discreetly through arbitrage often captures the business of coveted accounts such as the World Bank. 

   "When I have to move a billion or two, yield curve arbitrage is very often the only way you get market-making ability," says Yves Balcer, senior manager of the World Bank's $10 billion bond portfolio. 

   But not all dealers are good at this demanding trading strategy. 
Bond managers and even competitors consistently pick Bear Stearns and the secretive bond firm Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. as the Street's best arbitrage firms, rather than giant bond traders such as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and First Boston Corp. 

   Because they are good at this technique, Bear Searns and Greenwich often provide better execution than larger firms, bond investors said. 
Both firms have been known as expert arbs for years. 
"When we had to move a billion-dollar position it was often easier to go to Bear Stearns or Greenwich," says Donald Allison, who formerly traded for the World Bank. 

   Of course, the prime mover of the yield curve is the Federal Reserve, which guides short-term interest rates by controlling the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans. 

   Throughout last fall, the Fed maintained a tight grip on money. 
From September to December, it pushed the federal funds rate to about 9% from 8.25%. 

   Here's how Bear Stearns traded the yield curve in that rising short-term rate environment. 

   In three days in September, Bear Stearns sold "short" $5 billion in shortterm interest rate futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, $2.5 billion in one-year Treasury bills, and $1 billion in two-year notes. (In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed securities, hoping to profit by buying them back later at a cheaper price.) Keep in mind that a bond's yield moves in the opposite direction of its price. 
So, by selling these securities short, Bear Stearns expected them to drop in price and rise in yield. 

   In the same period, Bear Stearns bought $375 million of 10-year Treasury notes and $260 million 30-year bonds. 
That position offset some of the risk of the firm's huge short position. 

   By the middle of February, Bear Stearns reversed the trade, buying back the securities sold short and selling the notes and bonds it had bought. 
In the meantime, sharply rising short-term rates had changed the shape of the yield curve. 
Bear Stearns earned millions on its short positions as short-term interest rates ratcheted up, yet barely lost money on the longer-term securities it owned. 

   The result? 
Bear Stearns earned about $20 million on the trade. 

   Yield-curve arbitrage first became highly profitable in the early 1970s, when the Vietnam war sent inflation upward and interest rates began to gyrate. 
Then, in 1979, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker switched monetary policy to focus on controlling money growth, not interest rates. 
The result was tremendous swings in rates, heaven for arbitragers. 

   "It was like picking gold bricks up off the street," recalls William Michaelcheck, co-head of fixed income at Bear Stearns. 

   Now, just about all bond dealers realize the importance of arbitrage. 
But trading styles on Wall Street differ. 
Some firms still run outright speculative positions in which they either own or short huge blocks of bonds. 

   Arbitragers such as those at Bear Stearns don't speculate in large outright positions, but try to make money by arbitraging when the firm trades bonds for its own account or for clients. 

   Mr. Michaelcheck of Bear Stearns made arbitrage a priority at the firm when he joined from the World Bank in the early 1970s. 
At Greenwich Capital, co-founders Edwin Knetzger III and William Rainer saw arbitrage as a way to compete against such giant bond houses as Salomon Brothers Inc. and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. that had more capital. 
Arbitrage also allows cost-conscious dealers to discard the expensive appendages of outright bets on bonds -- namely, an economics staff to forecast rates and a staff abroad to watch the house account in foreign markets overnight. 

   Wall Street bond traders say the macho trading style of taking big outright risks will prevail at most firms. 
But that can mean trading results that swing regularly between big gains and losses. 
Arbitrage firms, by contrast, are more likely to make money steadily.

   National Intergroup Inc.'s largest shareholder urged the ouster of Howard M. Love as chairman and chief executive officer, citing losses incurred by the company in six of the past seven years. 

   Separately, the company reported that profit for its fiscal-first quarter, ended June 30, rose 37% to $13 million, or 53 cents a share, from $9.5 million, or 37 cents a share, a year ago. 
Most of the gain, however, came in the company's steel business, which is slated to be sold. 
The company's current strategy is to concentrate on its drug-distribution business. 

   The written request by Walker Street Associates Limited Partnership which owns 8.8% of National Intergroup's stock, cited the company's "recurring writedowns, chronic operating losses and loss of key customers," including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
The letter, signed by Walker Street's president, Steven M. Mizel, said Mr. Love was able to stay in his post because he is a "hunting, fishing and golfing crony of some of the directors." 

   Mr. Love said that while Walker Associates cites six years of losses, it has been a shareholder only during the year the company improved its performance.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it suspended trading in Lifeline Healthcare Group Ltd. securities for 10 days, citing concerns about the company's assets, operations and news releases. 

   The SEC said the suspension, which ends Aug. 4, was ordered because of questions about recent activity in the company's securities as well as publicly disseminated information involving the company's business operations, acquisitions and major stockholders. 

   Lifeline Healthcare, a Broken Arrow, Okla., health-care-services concern, said it asked the National Association of Securities Dealers in April to investigate transactions involving its stock. 
In a statement, the company said it hoped the SEC would identify brokers the company believes engaged in illegal short selling of its stock. 
Regarding previously released financial information, the company said its independent auditing firm stood behind its financial statements as of Dec. 31. 

   The company's stock, which has been trading around $15 a share, jumped to as high as $17.75 on Monday before falling back to $15.125 Tuesday.

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve loosened its credit clamp again, and many economists expect further interest-rate declines in coming weeks. 

   Banks are likely to react to the Fed's latest move by matching Chase Manhattan Bank's prime-rate cut earlier this month to 10 1/2% from 11%. 
That will automatically lead to declines in many consumer lending rates tied to the prime, such as home-equity loans, and it will also mean lower rates for many small and medium-sized businesses. 

   But the Fed's latest credit-easing step did little to stir much enthusiasm in the bond markets. 
Treasury bond prices hardly budged all day, finishing close to Tuesday's late levels. 
One reason is that the Fed move had been widely expected. 
Also, the dollar fell in the currency markets, commodity prices rose, and investors are bracing for a huge volume of new Treasury borrowing expected in August. 

   Rates on short-term Treasury bills rose slightly. 
But the yield on the Treasury's new two-year notes, sold yesterday, averaged 7.75%, the lowest in over a year. 

   Corporate bond prices were flat, both on investment-grade issues as well on junk bonds. 
Junk-bond traders said there was little reaction to news that House and Senate negotiators approved steps to crack down on risky investments by thrift institutions. 
That included a ban on investing in junk issues, the high-yielding bonds of companies with low credit ratings or no ratings at all. 

   The Fed sent strong signals of a credit-easing move when it took no action, for the second day in a row, to prevent a decline in the interest rate on federal funds. 
This rate on overnight loans between banks is watched because the Fed often uses it as a signal for credit-policy changes. 
The rate averaged just over 9%, down from its range earlier this month of about 9 1/4%. 

   Paul DeNoon, an analyst at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp., said the first signal of a credit-easing move came Tuesday, and yesterday provided "the confirmation." 
If the Fed wasn't easing, "I don't think they would have tolerated" the lower funds rate for two days in a row. 

   Some bond traders initially reacted warily. 
They said it's too soon to be sure if the Fed has eased credit because yesterday was the final day of a two-week period in which banks must settle their reserve positions with the central bank. 
On such days, the funds rate often moves purely for technical reasons. 

   Nonetheless, the Fed's recent actions have convinced many investment managers that the central bank has moved to ease credit. 
Fed officials have indicated they want to see lower short-term interest rates to help bolster the economy. 

   Government reports today and over the next week are likely to reinforce the case for easier credit and pave the way for further moves. 

   Today, the Commerce Department will estimate the economy's second-quarter performance. 
According to the average estimate of 17 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the economy grew at a 2% annual rate, after adjusting for inflation. 
On Aug. 4, the Labor Department will report July employment. 

   Treasury Securities 

   Individual investors bought large amounts of new two-year Treasury notes at yesterday's auction. 

   The average annual yield on the notes was 7.75%. 
That was down from 8.26% at the previous two-year note auction June 27, 1989, and was the lowest since 7.64% on April 27, 1988. 

   The Treasury received $1.49 billion in non-competitive tenders, which come mainly from individual investors. 
That was up sharply from $987 million at the June auction. 

   In the bond markets, the government's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2019 rose 3/32 to 108 18/32, to yield 8.10%. 
The 10-year notes were unchanged at 107 13/32, to yield 8%. 

   Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bills were quoted late yesterday at a discount rate of 8.02% bid, up slightly from 8% Tuesday. 
The latest six-month bills were quoted at a discount rate of 7.62% bid, up from 7.59%. 

   Here are details of the Treasury's two-year note auction yesterday: 

   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. 
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. 
@ 2-Year Notes 
@ Applications $28,675,425,000 
@ Accepted bids $9,006,620,000 
@ Accepted at low price 49% 
@ Accepted noncompetitively $1,491,000,000 
@ Average price (Rate) 100.000 (7.75%) 
@ High price (Rate) 100.136 (7.73%) 
@ Low price (Rate) 100.000 (7.75%) 
@ Interest rate 7 3/4% 

   The notes are dated July 31 and mature July 31, 1991. 

   Corporate Issues 

   Junk bond prices were flat as traders shrugged off news that the nation's thrifts would be required to divest their junk bond holdings within five years. 

   "The market reacts only to surprises and this was no surprise," said Alan Schlesinger, head of junk bond trading at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. "Legislation curbing thrifts from investing in the junk market has been anticipated for some time, so there has been no reaction from the market," he said. 

   Still, some traders said that while the legislation had been anticipated, many investors and dealers had been expecting a bill that would allow limited investments in junk bonds. 

   House and Senate conferees decided yesterday to bar thrifts from directly investing in junk bonds and requiring them to divest their holdings no later than Aug. 1, 1994. 
The proposal allows junk bond investment in separately capitalized affiliates of thrift institutions. 

   Traders and analysts say the five-year time frame for thrifts to divest the $15 billion of junk bonds held by them will temper any negative impact. 

   "Five years is a couple of generations in the junk bond world," said one junk bond trader. 
"The market has grown tremendously in the past few years and this isn't going to be a problem." 

   Today, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. plans to price a $200 million 10-year senior subordinated debenture offering by Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Inc. 
The issue is already oversubscribed, sources said. 

   In the investment-grade market, corporate issues closed unchanged. 

   In other corporate bond market news, Wall Street underwriting firms will see increased competition as three more commercial banks were given the green light to underwrite and trade corporate bonds. 

   The Federal Reserve Board gave final approval to units of Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and Bankers Trust New York Corp. to underwrite and deal in corporate debt. 
They will join a J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. unit in the business. 

   Philip Morris Cos. tapped the new-issue market with a $300 million, five-year note offering priced at a yield spread of 0.95 percentage point above the five-year Treasury note, to yield 8.725%. 
Municipal Issues 

   Municipal bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading. 

   The negotiated pricing sector was topped by a $192 million issue from the Jacksonville Transportation Authority, Fla., through underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc. 
The issue was oversubscribed, according to the lead underwriter. 

   Yields for the senior lien bonds range from 5.80% in 1990 to 7% in 2013. 
The junior lien bonds were priced to yield from 5.80% in 1990 to 6.50% in 1998. 

   In the secondary, or resale market, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds were quoted at 98 3/4, off 1/4, to yield 7.29%. 

   Mortgage-Backed Securities 

   Mortgage securities rose 3/32 point, despite a $500 million sale by New West Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association. 

   New West, formed with the troubled assets of California-based American Savings &amp; Loan Association, once the nation's largest thrift, sold $500 million of Ginnie Mae 9% securities through competitive bidding. 

   The sale is believed to the first from New West's mortgage securities portfolio, estimated at $13 billion. 
Officials at Ranieri Wilson &amp; Co., which is managing the New West mortgage-backed liquidation program, weren't available for comment. 

   Elsewhere, Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for August delivery ended at 98 21/32, up 3/32, while its 9 1/2% issue closed at 100 21/32, up 3/32. 
Freddie Mac's 9 1/2% securities closed at 99 21/32, also up 3/32. 

   Meanwhile, homeowners are increasingly opting for fixed-rate mortgages over adjustable-rate loans, which should mean increased supply of fixed-rate mortgage securities in the secondary market. 

   A Federal National Mortgage Association survey found that applications for fixed-rate loans rose 34% in June after a 17% increase in May, while applications for adjustable-rate loans fell 28% in June after a 22% drop in May. 

   The shift to fixed-rate loans is expected to continue because they now are widely available for under 10%, while fully indexed ARM rates are higher, except for first-year teaser rates. 

   Foreign Bonds 

   British government bonds surged as the pound rallied on news of an unexpectedly small U.K. trade deficit. 

   Some actively traded British bonds rose about 3/4 point. 
The 11 3/4% bonds of 2003/2007 rose 23/32 point to 115, to yield 9.72%. 
The 12% issue due 1995 rose half a point to 106 11/32, to yield 10.44%. 

   The U.K. current account deficit for June was #1.49 billion, lower than the #1.6 billion pound deficit many economists had expected, although up from May's deficit of #1.32 billion. 

   Japanese government bond prices ended flat after swinging widely earlier in the day. 
Japan's benchmark No. 111, 4.6% bonds of 1998 finished unchanged at 96.79 to yield 5.125%. 
Volume was brisk. 

   Japan's Finance Ministry set a 4.9% coupon rate for an issue of 600 billion yen of 10-year government bonds. 
Forty percent of the 10-year issue will be auctioned today in Japan, while the rest will be distributed under fixed syndicate allotments at the average auction price. 
Traders expect the issue to yield just over 5%. 

   West German government bonds rose slightly. 
Bonn's 7% issue due February 1999 climbed 0.11 point to 102.41, while its yield fell to 6.64% from 6.66%.

   The company also said it estimates revenue for the first quarter, ended June 30, was "only slightly higher" than the $34.3 million reported last year. 

   The maker of data processing products announced earlier this year that first-quarter earnings would be lower than a year ago. 
Telxon attributed the lower-than-expected revenue to a longer cycle to develop and install customized systems.

<TEXT>
   Gary M. Wetstein, 51 years old, was appointed chairman and chief executive partner of BDO Seidman, the ninth biggest U.S. accounting firm, effective Oct. 1, 1990. 

   Mr. Wetstein will succeed John Abernathy, 52, who was appointed chairman in 1983 and whose second term expires next year. 

   To some accounting specialists, Mr. Wetstein is a man in the hot seat. 
The firm's year-to-year-revenue growth for the year ended June 30 slowed to 14% from 15% in fiscal 1988, and 30% in both fiscal 1987 and 1986. 
Some of the dozen or so mergers made over the past few years have been slow to integrate into Seidman. 
And problems in relatively new corporate finance and personal finances units have slowed growth. 
Also, consulting hasn't expanded as quickly as desired. 

   "I feel we now have our problems behind us," said Mr. Wetstein, who has been regional managing partner in Seidman's Midwest region based in Detroit for the past two years. 
"Now we're ready to charge ahead with a dedicated staff. 
And with the current megamergers of Big Eight accounting firms, we plan to benefit by hiring a lot of top-notch people who fall out of these combinations." 

   Mergers recently have been announced between Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young &amp; Co. and Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells and Touche Ross &amp; Co. 

   Accounting specialists say that because Seidman has been undergoing growth and profit-margin problems, it was important to set up lines of succession early for new leadership. 
They also say that second-tier accounting firms are under enormous competitive pressure from major accounting firms that wish to lure away the smaller firms' middle-sized clients. 

   "The second-tier firms must prosper or they will surely die," said George H. Sorter, an accounting and law professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. 
"If they become mindless, smaller versions of Big Eight firms, they'll never make it." 

   A spokesman for the firm said: "It's ridiculous to say we need early leadership since the firm's current chairman was named a year in advance. 
We do it because the partnership agreement specifies that a new chief executive partner be picked a year in advance in order to have a smooth transition period." 

   The firm said Messrs. 
Wetstein and Abernathy will work together during the transition period. 
The firm's partnership agreements also limit terms for chief executive to two, although Mr. Abernathy's predecessor to the job, B.Z. Lee, was permitted to serve three terms by a special vote of the partners. 

   Mr. Abernathy said "that there is an advantage to getting new blood to head the firm." 
Asked whether he would have liked a third term, Mr. Abernathy said: "It's a very interesting job but a third term wasn't available under the partnership agreement." 

   Mr. Wetstein said that the firm's corporate finance group recently named a new top executive and that it had recently aided in two mergers of manufacturing companies in the Midwest. 
"We're definitely back on track and getting new business," he said. 
The personal finance unit has closed one of five offices in Houston and has cut back personnel to 20 from more than 30 a year ago, he noted. 

   "We can't add all the new products we've been offering to clients, such as litigation suport and real estate appraisal, without having some fallout," said Mr. Wetstein. 

   Seidman, with such public clients as Interface Flooring Systems Inc., Leslie Fay Inc. and Earl Scheib Inc. and such closely held clients as Steelcase Inc. and Amway Corp., had annual revenue of $177 million in the year ended June 30, up from $155 million a year earlier. 
In the U.S., the firm has 315 partners for a total of 2,000 people on its professional staff in 43 offices. 
It is the U.S. member firm of BDO Binder, based in Brussels, which is the seventh biggest world-wide accounting organization with 1988 revenue of $793 million.

   Loral Corp. posted a 12% profit drop for the first quarter ended June 30 and said it is "cautiously optimistic" that the government will sustain a contract that a competitor protested. 

   The New York defense-electronics concern's board also voted to lift the quarterly dividend 11%, to 20 cents a share from 18 cents, payable Sept. 15 to stock of record Aug. 28. 

   Net income declined to $17.3 million, or 69 cents a share, from $19.6 million, or 78 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 
Profit from continuing operations rose 36%, to $16.6 million from $12.2 million, because of lower interest cost and improved profit margins. 

   Sales fell 9% to $232.7 million from $256 million. 
But Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman and chief executive officer, told shareholders at the annual meeting here that he expects softer-than-expected bookings to be reversed. 

   Mr. Schwartz also said he expects per-share earnings from continuing operations for the year ending March 31 to rise 40%, to about $3.40 from $2.41 a year earlier.

   The Randolph, Mass., doughnut chain said that Judge Edward Harrington ordered Kingsbridge to send to Dunkin' shareholders a revised offer that discloses an opinion by the Ontario Securities Commission that Unicorp Canada Corp., a Toronto management and investment concern, and co-owner of Kingsbridge, violated Canadian securities laws in a previous takeover attempt.

   Tokyo stocks retreated from a morning surge to close lower on profit-taking. 

   London share prices closed easier but above their lows for the day as a few of the leading stocks managed to buck the market's overall negative tone. 

   In Tokyo, brokers said investors pulled back in the afternoon in the belief that the market is due for a correction. 
Upward pressure on prices pushed the Nikkei index to a record Tuesday. 

   "The market has been going up on a lot of hot air so it's deflating," said Pelham Smithers, an analyst at Yamaichi Securities Co. 

   The market has been flush with cash from investment trust funds, which played a role in this week's push on the Nikkei, brokers said. 

   Yesterday, the Nikkei average of 225 issues fell 23.07 points to 34515.83 after reaching a high of 34771.21 points in early trading. 
The index gained 445.57 points Tuesday. 

   Volume on the first section was estimated at one billion shares, in line with 1.03 billion shares Tuesday. 
The market reached one billion shares, a benchmark for a healthy trading day, Tuesday for the first time since June 1. 

   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 569 to 330, and 187 issues were unchanged. 

   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which rose 37.46 points to a record Tuesday, was up 2.06 points at 2586.13. 

   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 126.27 points to 34642.10. 

   Yesterday was the last trading day for July settlement, so some brokers were anticipating quiet dealings. 
Traders usually hesitate to take new cash positions on the last day of trade for fear of hurting the month's accounts. 

   Brokers anticipate heavy trading this morning, which is technically the first day of trade for the August settlement. 
The market opened higher, with the Nikkei remaining above record levels through much of the session. 
Large institutional investors and individuals took part in the rally, and buying was focused on domestic-demand stocks, brokers said. 

   A broad section of the market traded higher in the rally, with conspicuous gains in construction and housing-related issues. 
But the rally lost steam in the afternoon, with brokers engaging in profit-taking. 

   Steel stocks fell. 
One analyst said Nippon Steel looked as though it could surge beyond 890 yen but hit resistance and was sold off for profits in the afternoon. 
Nippon Steel closed down 2 yen (1 cent) at 865 yen ($6.10) after reaching a high of 880 yen. 
Kawasaki Steel fell 10 yen to 930 yen, off from a high of 955. 
Sumitomo Metal dropped 23 yen to 826, off from a high of 853. 

   Construction stocks were also sold off in the afternoon. 
Taisei ended flat at 1,690 yen, off from a high of 1,710, and Ohbayashi was flat at 1,900 yen, off from a high of 1,930. 

   Banks, which were a large part of the market rally in financial issues early in the week, were easier. 
Sumitomo Bank was down 40 yen at 3,680, Mitsubishi Bank fell 30 yen to 3,360, and Fuji Bank was down 20 yen at 3,610. 

   Bid speculation in the stores sector and the start of trading in the shares of newly merged SmithKline Beecham were rare highlights of a lackluster session. 

   News early in the day of a better than expected British trade deficit in June failed to inspire the market, though analysts said the figures again reduced the likelihood of a further rise in U.K. base lending rates. 

   Trading conditions remained quiet throughout the day, with many participants absent or unwilling to deal because of another one-day transport strike in London. 

   News that representatives of the U.S. House and Senate have agreed to require savings and loans institutions to sell off junk bond holdings over a five-year period came too late to affect the London market, which closed an hour early because of the transport strike. 

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 4.9 points lower at 2264.5, well above the day's low of 2258.3. 

   The Financial Times 30-share index closed off 0.2 points at 1885.8. 
Volume was a modest 315.3 million shares, compared with 461.7 million shares in Tuesday's full trading session. 

   Britain's June trade deficit rose to #1.89 billion ($3.09 billion) from #1.72 billion ($2.82 billion) in May but was below general market expectations of a trade gap of around #2 billion. 
The current account gap widened to #1.49 billion from #1.32 billion but was also below expectations of a #1.6 billion deficit. 

   The major stocks tended to drift in negative territory through the day. 
Among the leading shares, Glaxo Holdings ended 10 pence (16 cents) lower at #13.93 ($22.82), and British Aerospace closed 4 pence lower at 703 pence. 

   The stores sector saw some gains in active trading, boosted by vague rumors of a bid for Dixons Group by an unnamed West German consortium. 
But the rumors failed to provoke much of a rise in Dixons, which closed 2 pence higher at 168 pence. 

   Among the other stores, Kingfisher advanced 4 pence to 342 on trading volume of 3.9 million shares, and Marks &amp; Spencer was down 0.5 pence at 201.5 on volume of 2.6 million shares. 

   In Frankfurt, share prices climbed further, boosted by bullish market sentiment and waning expectations of higher West German interest rates. 
Traders said stocks rallied in the morning after a strong close Tuesday and indications of easing interest rates. 

   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Zurich, Brussels, Stockholm and Milan and mixed in Paris and Amsterdam. 
South African gold stocks closed higher. 

   In other Asian and Pacific trading, share prices closed lower in Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul and higher in Sydney, Manila, Taipei and Wellington. 

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. 
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. 
The percentage change is since year-end.

@  Precious-Metals Futures Prices Edge Higher
@  In Reaction to Weaker Dollar, Firmer Market Tone

   Precious-metals futures prices edged higher, mostly in reaction to a weaker dollar. 

   Gold for August delivery ended with a gain of 90 cents an ounce at $375, while September-delivery silver was up 1.5 cents an ounce at $5.275. 
October platinum advanced $4.60 an ounce to $501.20. 

   Some buying of contracts by traders who had sold short in the belief that prices would fall contributed to the slightly firmer tone, according to Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors Inc., New York. 

   There was some demand for gold from Zurich, Mr. Nichols said, but rather than being a factor in futures prices, the Swiss demand was actually caused by the steadier tone in the futures market, he said. 

   Dealers said there was slightly more activity in the bullion market, according to Mr. Nichols, but he said their comments seemed to be mostly attempts to find a reason for the market's gains. 

   "Actually, all we have is a market that moves a few points higher one day and a few points lower another day," he said. 

   Mr. Nichols said the August gold contract was trading in a range of about $369 to $380. 
"If it rises or falls outside that range, then there will be good reasons why the action has taken place, but not until then," he said. 

   But despite yesterday's rise in futures prices, according to Craig Sloane, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., New York, precious metals "haven't moved up as much as the dollar has gone down over the past two days." 

   But he said foreign currencies are displaying a persistent strength against the dollar that may signal a new trend. 

   "If there is a definite breakout by foreign currencies, and they become much stronger than the dollar -- something that can happen by the end of the week -- precious metals could well take their cue and react accordingly," Mr. Sloane said. 
"When precious-metals traders become convinced that a down trend in the dollar has been established, they may react quickly to catch up" by buying metals. 

   Another analyst said that although the weaker dollar didn't bring much buying into precious metals, "it did tend to stifle short selling, so in that sense it was a positive factor." 

   John Norris, director of precious-metals trading at Citibank, New York, said August gold went above $375 an ounce but couldn't stay up there, indicating the market could only hold onto minor advances. 

   "What the market needs is a really sharp fall in the dollar, accompanied by a drop in interest rates," he said. 

   Traders were awaiting today's release of U.S. gross national product data, he said. 
If the figure is low, it could give traders confidence that there will be some easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board, he said. 

   In other commodity markets yesterday: 

   SUGAR: Futures prices extended Tuesday's advances. 
The October contact ended with a gain of 0.13 cent a pound at 14.22 cents. 
It rose to as high as 14.67 cents in early trading after the Soviet Union confirmed it bought a large quantity of sugar, but profit-taking later trimmed the advance. 
The head of Prodintorg, the Soviet buying agency, said Moscow bought 250,000 tons of refined sugar, in addition to the 150,000 tons of raw sugar it bought previously, to meet rising domestic demand. 
In addition, an analyst reported that the Indonesian Sugar Council said Indonesia's sugar imports this year will amount to 621,000 tons, far above the 180,000 tons it imported last year. 
The analyst also said traders were still awaiting results of Syria's tender on Tuesday to buy 24,000 tons of refined sugar for September shipment. 

   COPPER: Futures prices extended Tuesday's easing trend. 
The September contract fell one cent a pound to $1.1155. 
Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York, said the market has been seeing profit-taking ever since prices rallied early this month. 
Mr. Demler also expressed concern over the relatively low level of copper supplies. 
Inventories in U.S. producer hands, as of the end of June, amounted to 24,000 tons, compared with a high point of 70,000 tons in March 1988. 
Globally, supplies held by producers, consumers, merchants and exchanges total only 590,000 tons, or about 3.6 weeks' consumption, Mr. Demler said. 
This is a gain of 20,000 tons since the end of 1988, which contrasts with the usual pattern of bigger increases at this time of year. 
"Since 1973, there has been a gain on the average during July and August, the slow production months of the year, of 60,000 tons," he said. 
If there isn't a pickup in accumulation of supplies this month and next, there could be tightness in the market this fall when demand for copper picks up, he said. 

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed mixed in narrow trading as the markets "consolidated somewhat from their losses of the previous two days," said Joel Karlin, a futures analyst in Chicago with Research Department Inc. Buoyed by reports of continued export demand, wheat prices remained the firmest among grain futures, said Ted Mao, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York. 
September wheat futures gained two cents to close at $3.8825 on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
Scattered showers across the Eastern corn and soybean belt, including a thunderstorm that lingered over the Board of Trade building and Chicago's Loop business district, kept futures prices for these crops from hanging onto gains posted early in the trading session.

   Eastman Kodak Co., hoping to strengthen its position in the electronic-imaging industry, unveiled a digital printer capable of producing photographic-like hard prints of images on a computer screen. 

   The Kodak XL 7700 printer, targeted for high-end users of computers, can produce prints with higher resolution and image quality than any currently on the market, the company said. 
The printer would be used in computer-aided design, medical diagnostic imaging and aerial mapping where photographic quality is preferred. 

   Kodak said the printer, which will retail for $18,895 for the black-and-white only model and $24,895 for the color and black-and-white model, will be available in January.

@  Niagara Mohawk Problems With Power Plant
@  Spur Expectations That It Will Omit Payout

<TEXT>
   Today, Wall Street is expecting Niagara Mohawk Power to commit what, for any utility investor, is the ultimate sin: omitting the dividend. 

   "It'll be close to a miracle" if directors at today's meeting vote to maintain the regular quarterly payout of 30 cents a share, says Edward Tirello of Shearson Lehman Hutton. 

   The problem is rooted in the company's 20-year-old nuclear plant, Nine Mile Point 1. 
Persistent problems with management, training and equipment have kept the plant out of service since December 1987. 
And so Niagara Mohawk, based in Syracuse, N.Y., has had to buy replacement power from other utilities, a cost that keeps eating away at its earnings. 

   Normally a utility can recover such costs from customers. 
But New York state officials decided late last year that Niagara Mohawk has brought this problem on itself through poor management, and thus should suffer the financial consequences. 

   The fallout has been severe. 
First-quarter profit declined 37%, as the company shelled out roughly $400,000 a day to buy replacement power. 
"They're at the breaking point as far as the dividend is concerned," says Daniel Scotto of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities. 

   Niagara Mohawk isn't saying much. 
Asked specifically if the dividend is in trouble, a company spokesman says: "Management hasn't made its recommendation" to directors yet. 

   But while analysts are convinced that Niagara Mohawk is going to bite the bullet on the dividend, they are sharply divided on whether investors should buy or sell the stock. 

   Danielle Seitz of Smith Barney, Harris Upham acknowledges that Niagara Mohawk isn't for the "faint-hearted." 
Yet she calls it an attractive buy at yesterday's closing price of 12 1/8. 
"Sure you may lose money on the dividend {if it's omitted}, but you stand to make a lot when the stock goes up," Ms. Seitz says. 
Nine Mile 1 should be back in operation within six to eight months, she says, and within about 12 months the shares should hit 14 to 15. 
"Niagara Mohawk is one of the most undervalued stocks right now," she says emphatically. 

   But John Kellenyi of Drexel Burnham Lambert says sell. 
He acknowledges that Nine Mile 1 probably will come back on line by year end or so, with dividends resumed shortly after that. 
But he doubts the utility will generate sufficient profit to make payouts at the current annual rate of $1.20 a share. 
Instead he looks for an annual dividend rate of no more than 80 cents to $1 a share in 1990. 
Only if the stock price drops to around 10 would he be a buyer. 

   Barry Abramson of Prudential-Bache Securities rates Niagara Mohawk a "weak hold." 
If you're an investor who looks primarily at asset values, he says, "you've got to like" Niagara Mohawk because it's selling below book value, compared with the electric-utility group's average of 35% above book value. 
But if you're more interested in income, he says, "you want to avoid" the stock. 

   Other recent asset plays in the electric-utility group have paid off handsomely for the more speculative investor. 
General Public Utilities, CMS Energy and Long Island Lighting are just a few of the power companies whose stock prices have bounced back nicely after being pummeled by nuclear-plant woes -- although in Lilco's case especially, there have been plenty of ups and downs along the way. 

   Whether Niagara Mohawk will join that group, some analysts say, depends on whether it can convince the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission that it is finally coming to grips with its nuclear problems. 
In May, NRC's Region I Administrator William Russell blasted Niagara Mohawk's nuclear management in a written assessment. 
"Russell makes a Marine drill sergeant look like a pansy," observes Mr. Tirello of Shearson Lehman. 

   For investors, the problem is that the longer it takes Niagara Mohawk to convince the NRC that Nine Mile 1 is ready for a restart, the harder it will be for the company to turn around. 
The Niagara Mohawk spokesman says only that Nine Mile 1's restart won't come before the end of the third quarter at the earliest. 

   Analysts suspect that a deal may be in the works between the utility and New York state officials, under which the company could start recovering its replacement-power costs from customers in exchange for either a moratorium on dividend payouts, a change in top management, or both. 
Niagara Mohawk acknowledges that "discussions" are under way with the New York State Public Service Commission, the state attorney general and others. 
But it won't divulge the subject of the talks.

   Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., a Hong Kong investment firm, said it lowered its stake in Central Pacific Corp. to 9.83% of the common shares outstanding. 

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Industrial Equity said it sold 836,000 Central Pacific common shares July 18 for $13 each. 
It now holds 549,755 shares of the bank holding company, the filing said. 

   No reason was given for the reduction. 

   In Bakersfield, Calif., Central Pacific President Linn Wiley said Industrial Equity hasn't said why it is selling its Central Pacific stock. 
Last January, Industrial Equity indicated it would sell all its Central Pacific holdings. 
"We believe it is a matter of a change in their overall investment mix or strategy," Mr. Wiley said.

   General Motors Corp.'s two big technology subsidiaries reported improved second-quarter earnings, but the auto maker's finance unit said its net income fell 19.6%, partly because of higher borrowing costs. 

   GM's data processing subsidiary, Electronic Data Systems Corp., said profit rose 9.6%, while GM Hughes Electronics Corp., the unit that includes GM's aerospace and vehicle electronics businesses, improved its earnings 42% from a year earlier. 
The two units have independently traded classes of stock representing dividend interests in their earnings. 

   General Motors Acceptance Corp. earnings are combined with profits from the No. 1 auto maker's other operations. 
GM is expected to report results for its common stock today. 

   GMAC said net income in the latest quarter dropped to $268.6 million from $333.9 million a year ago. 
Largely because of cut-rate vehicle financing and leasing programs undertaken to stimulate GM's car and truck sales, GMAC's financing and leasing business in the U.S. rose 27%. 
But the unit said earnings were hurt because average world-wide borrowing costs were 20% higher in the latest quarter than a year earlier. 

   In the first six months, GMAC's earnings fell 9.2% to $625 million from $688.3 million a year earlier. 

   At EDS, profit rose to $104.9 million, or 87 cents a share, from $95.7 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. 
A 29% jump in business from non-GM accounts helped boost revenue in the quarter 15% to $1.37 billion from $1.19 billion a year ago. 
Non-GM revenue accounted for 44% of EDS's total business, compared with 39% a year earlier. 
EDS officials have said they want non-GM business to equal revenue from the parent by the end of next year. 

   In the first half, EDS earned $204.9 million, or $1.69 a share, up 11% from $184.8 million, or $1.51 a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 15% to $2.66 billion from $2.32 billion. 

   GM Class E shares, which represent a dividend interest in EDS earnings, closed at $52.50, up 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

   At GM Hughes Electronics, the unit that includes Hughes Aircraft Co. and Delco Electronics Corp., profit was $203.1 million, or 60 cents a share, up 42% from year-earlier earnings of $142.9 million, or 45 cents a share, before a one-time gain of $21 million, or five cents a share. 
The gain was from sale of holdings in Nippon Avionics Co. Revenue rose to $2.88 billion from $2.87 billion. 

   In the first half, GM Hughes had net income of $376 million, or $1.11 a share. 
In the year-earlier period, profit before one-time gains was $291.6 million, or 90 cents a share. 
A $68.3 million gain from sale of Nippon Avionics stock and an $18.7 million gain from an accounting change made net income for the year-earlier first half $378.6 million, or $1.13 a share. 
The unit's revenue for the first six months of 1989 was $5.89 billion, up 6% from $5.54 billion in the year-earlier period. 

   GM Class H shares closed at $30, up 25 cents, in Big Board trading.

   Two West German banks announced foreign acquisitions, reflecting the German banking industry's drive to broaden its presence and product offerings in Europe in anticipation of an integrated European Community financial market after 1992. 

   Bayerische Hypotheken-&amp; Wechsel Bank AG, West Germany's fifth-largest private-sector bank, said it acquired a 50% stake in Foreign &amp; Colonial Management Ltd., a London investment trust manager, for #17.5 million ($28.8 million). 
And Deutsche Bank AG, West Germany's largest bank, said it purchased Antoni, Hacker &amp; Co. of Vienna, a small, privately held bank, for an undisclosed sum. 

   Foreign &amp; Colonial and Hypo-Bank, as its West German purchaser is known, said in a joint statement that they expect investments in managed funds by private and institutional investors to grow substantially in Europe over the next few years. 
The arrangement significantly expands the investment range of the Munich-based Hypo-Bank, which is better known for its extensive mortgage business. 
Foreign &amp; Colonial had invested funds of #2.8 billion ($4.61 billion) as of June 30th. 

   For Foreign &amp; Colonial, the agreement brings financial clout and a broader distribution range for its investment products, said James Ogilvy, the firm's chairman and chief executive. 
Mr. Ogilvy revealed plans to jointly expand the trust's retail activities into France, Italy and Spain. 

   "Every U.K. investment manager today has two choices: either to find one's niche and become a boutique, or to expand internationally," Mr. Ogilvy said. 
"If you decide on the latter, as we did, you have to stake your claim early and find the right partner." 

   Deutsche Bank has been staking out new territory since 1986 with a string of bank acquisitions in Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. 
Antoni, Hacker will be used as the nucleus for a major expansion of Deutsche Bank's Austrian business, which will include asset management, trading in securities and foreign exchange, securities underwriting and corporate finance. 

   Deutsche Bank said business opportunities with Austrian industry were underscored by Vienna's recent application for admission to the EC.

   Britain's merchandise trade balance was in deficit by #1.89 billion ($3.09 billion) in June on a seasonally adjusted basis, widened from a deficit of #1.72 billion in May, while the current account was in deficit by #1.49 billion, compared with a month-earlier deficit of #1.32 billion, the Department of Trade and Industry said. 

   The figures compare with market expectations of a merchandise trade deficit of #2 billion and a current account deficit of #1.6 billion. 
The current account, or balance of payments, is a measure of trade in goods and services and certain other transactions.

   The World Bank and its affiliate, the International Development Association, approved $100.9 million in loans to Kenya and Indonesia. 

   Kenya will get a $64.8 million IDA credit to help finance improvements in the public water-supply system serving the Nairobi area. 
The population of this East African capital is more than 1.3 million, and is expected to reach 2.5 million during the next 15 years. 

   The World Bank cleared a $36.1 million loan to help Indonesia improve the management of public-works projects carried out by various government units. 

   The IDA credit to Kenya will be interest-free except for administrative fees, while the World Bank loan to Indonesia will be at a variable lending rate, currently 7.73% a year.

   The Federal Reserve Board gave three more commercial banking companies -- Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp. and Bankers Trust New York Corp. -- the green light to underwrite and deal to a limited extent in rated and unrated corporate debt securities in the U.S. 

   Within minutes of the approval, Chase Securities Inc., the new securities affiliate of the big bank, made its first trade of corporate debt. 
Similarly, a Bankers Trust spokesman said its BT Securities unit was prepared to exercise its powers immediately. 

   Regarding Chase's quick use of the new powers, Richard J. Canty, senior vice president for corporate securities at Chase, said, "When you have had a corporate trading desk set up for five months and when there are no impediments, legal or otherwise, you let people do their job." 

   The securities industry, which has fought banks' entry into their domain, had expected the latest round of approvals. 
On June 19, the Fed made J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. the first commercial bank to gain clearance for underwriting and dealing in corporate debt securities since the Glass-Steagall Act divorced banking from securities in 1933. 

   The Securities Industry Association has a lawsuit pending in the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia challenging the Fed's approval as a violation of federal laws separating banking and securities. 
The trade group's request for expedited handling of the case has been denied. 

   The banks' entry into the corporate securities market comes as Wall Street firms are retrenching in the face of sagging trading volumes and slimmer margins. 
Banks have wanted to enter the securities business because many of their better corporate customers forsake traditional bank loans in favor of raising debt through the securities markets. 
One executive at a leading Wall Street firm, informed of the Fed's latest approvals, said, "The banks can have all the low-margin corporate debt offerings that they want." 

   But in a reference to the huge losses suffered following the deregulation of the London securities market earlier this decade, Mr. Canty said, "We don't want to aid and abet Big Bang II. 
A lot has changed during the last two years of what success means in the securities business. 
It isn't being at the top of the league tables anymore. 
We're only in the beginning of a major restructuring of the securities business, and we're going to be focusing on areas where we can add value to transactions for our clients." 

   Under the Fed approval, banks' securities affiliates are limited to having no more than 5% of their revenue come from corporate debt securities and other securities that had been off limits. 
The balance of the securities affiliates' revenue must come from such traditional bank activities as underwriting and dealing in federal and municipal debt. 

   The Fed currently has similar applications pending from a number of foreign banks, including Barclays PLC and Royal Bank of Canada.

   A sudden burst of program trading that may have been triggered by a news report about Chrysler Corp. sent stock prices soaring. 
Bond prices languished, and the dollar fell. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average spurted 29.97 points to close at 2613.05, the sixth time the average has set a post-crash high this month. 
Broader market measures advanced sharply too, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index ending at 338.05, its highest close ever. 
Long-term bond prices were about unchanged, and the dollar slumped against the mark and the yen. 

   Several analysts said the most plausible explanation for the explosive rise in stocks in the final half-hour of trading was a report on Dow Jones News Service that Chrysler was planning a restructuring. 
The report was soon denied by the company, but the market had already closed by then. 

   The report apparently triggered a surge in stock index futures, which then touched off program trading as arbitragers sold the futures and bought the underlying stocks. 
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp., said such a transaction could instantly lock in a gain of 15%. 

   Mr. Johnson, however, said he was skeptical of that explanation for the surge, saying the stock index futures hit their peak at 3:37 p.m. but the Chrysler report didn't appear on the news wire until 3:43 p.m. 
He acknowledged, however, that word of the report could have reached some traders a few minutes early. 

   Some analysts suggested that the gains were touched off when the federal funds rate -- the interest rate banks charge one another on overnight loans -- fell to just above 9% from its recent average of just above 9 1/4%. 
When the Federal Reserve for the second day in a row took no action to stop the decline in the rate, its inaction was widely interpreted as a sign that it had eased its credit policy and that interest rates will be declining further. 

   Meanwhile, technology stocks continued to slump, but entertainment issues staged a daylong rally. 
Analysts said many investors were buying in anticipation of the $7 billion they will be receiving for the 100 million shares of Warner Communications Inc. that Time Inc. bought Monday. 

   Bond prices languished as traders awaited today's second-quarter gross national product report. 
Economists' average projection is that second-quarter GNP rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 2%, compared with 4.4% in the first quarter. 

   In major market activity: 

   Stock prices spurted higher in active trading. 
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 188.3 million shares. 
Advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners 981-483. 

   Bond prices were about unchanged. 
The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.10%. 

   The dollar slipped against other major currencies. 
In late New York trading, it was quoted at 1.8675 marks and 140.02 yen, compared with 1.8830 marks and 141.45 yen.

   When a Grumman-built F-14 Tomcat shot down two Libyan fighters over the Mediterranean early this year, workers at Grumman Corp. headquarters celebrated by wearing special T-shirts emblazoned "U.S.: 2, Libya: 0." 

   Such macho pride has defined the corporate culture of Grumman throughout its 60 years as the premier supplier of naval aircraft. 
Sporting menacing names such as Hellcat and Avenger, sturdy Grumman planes helped turn the tide in the Pacific during World War II, with a young pilot named George Bush playing his part. 
Later -- in Korea, Vietnam, and most recently the Middle East -- Grumman jets roared off carrier decks to battle the hottest Soviet-built warplanes. 

   But now Grumman's planes may have finally met their match, done in by Pentagon budget cutters and deficit-conscious lawmakers. 
The House today is scheduled to take up Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's proposal to kill production of the F-14 as well as Grumman's venerable A-6 bombers, and the vote is expected to be close. 
The Senate Armed Services Committee already has voted to end production, and the full Senate is likely to go along. 

   The Pentagon chief argues that the planes, designed in the 1950s and '60s, are too expensive and that the military can't afford to keep the plants operating at inefficient low rates. 

   The cuts would eliminate thousands of jobs, lop off about a third of the company's $3.65 billion in annual sales, and forever change its character. 
Grumman would survive. 
In fact, current funding provides for production of F-14 and A-6 planes through 1991. 
But in one stroke, Grumman would be slated for elimination as a major aircraft manufacturer. 
Its only remaining aircraft would be non-combat craft such as cargo and radar planes that it builds for the Navy, although it is the lead contractor on developing the high-tech Joint STARS flying command post for the Air Force. 

   Analysts generally expect Grumman to earn about $73 million this year, off from last year's $86.5 million, which included a one-time gain. 
But profit margins are expected to improve in the company's electronics and truck businesses. 
Sales this year are expected to match or exceed last year's $3.65 billion, with 84% representing government business. 

   Loss of the F-14 contract would be unlikely to have much effect on Grumman's stock price, analysts say. 
Gary J. Reich, an aerospace-industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, notes that Grumman's stock has been stuck between $19 and $24 since the October 1987 crash. 

   Some analysts see Grumman as a takeover target as a result of its troubles. 
Chairman John O'Brien, however, says the company will stay independent, with 40% of the stock in the hands of employees. 

   The test of political wills over Grumman's fate has national as well as corporate implications. 
Grumman has "a proven track record of building carrier-based aircraft," says Robert Costello, who resigned as the Pentagon's top acquisition official several months ago. 
"That's a national asset. 
You can't just throw it away." 
Grumman's elimination would leave McDonnell Douglas Corp. as the only producer of carrier-based fighters. 

   But Grumman might not be the only defense contractor to see its role reduced or eliminated. 
In an era of shrinking military budgets and stepped-up arms-control negotiations with the Russians, defense planners predict an extended period of retrenchment and world-wide consolidation. 

   "The number of U.S. aircraft manufacturers clearly will have to shrink," says consultant Donald Hicks, a former defense undersecretary for research. 
"Firms that didn't look or plan far enough ahead will be changed forever, or perhaps disappear." 

   With the debate on Capitol Hill intensifying in recent days, Grumman's champions are fighting back ferociously. 
Hoping for a $1 billion package to save the F-14, home-state lawmakers are cutting deals to win votes by agreeing to back the pet programs of other congressmen. 

   Grumman's supporters have joined forces with powerful congressional delegations from Texas and Pennsylvania battling to save another weapon scheduled for Mr. Cheney's budget ax: the Marine Corps' V-22, a troop transport that takes off like a helicopter and cruises like a plane. 

   Company lobbyists are bad-mouthing competitors, leaning hard on subcontractors for political support and recruiting retired Navy brass to press their case. 
Nationwide television and newspaper ads trumpet the F-14s prowess, while Grumman's public-relations office has flooded newspapers and television stations with prepared articles and press releases intended to be used as news stories. 
But at best, Grumman can only delay the inevitable. 
The same budget pressures are bound to haunt the company's combat planes year after year. 

   "There's not enough money to go around for everybody's wish list," Vice President Dan Quayle told reporters Monday during a break in his efforts to lobby lawmakers to support the administration's defense cuts. 
Secretary Cheney, he said, has "made a very tough call" in targeting the F-14 and other programs. 
"Now we've got to deliver on it." 

   Although the company is battling to save the F-14 for a few more years, management already has grudgingly concluded that Grumman's long-term growth lies in other areas. 
Once the Navy moves on to the next generation of fighters, Grumman Chairman O'Brien concedes, "I see us having a difficult time staying in the carrier fighter business." 

   The economic impact would be huge -- and the human cost, too. 
Grumman estimates that killing the F-14 would cost 3,000 company jobs and perhaps force 20,000 or so layoffs by subcontractors, with the Long Island economy suffering the most. 
That would come on top of 5,000 jobs the company has eliminated over the past two years. 

   Generations of Long Island families have flocked to work in its assembly plants since Leroy Grumman, a former Navy officer and hotshot test pilot, founded the company in a garage in 1929. 
Grumman can outlive the Cheney cuts because much of its revenue already comes from other sources, including specialty military aircraft, work on satellites and the proposed space station, the assembling of mail trucks and even the manufacture of pontoon boats. 

   In fact, Grumman's booming military electronics business -- the most promising area for sustained growth -- is likely to exceed all of the company's current aircraft operations in the next several years. 

   But however lucrative the new work may be, it lacks the heart-pounding appeal of building supersonic jet fighters like the F-14 Tomcat, glorified by Hollywood in "Top Gun" and other movies. 
"It's hard to get the same product identification if you're making software packages for dataprocessing systems," Kurt Schroeder, the company's chief test pilot, observes. 

   Turning away from combat planes clearly would be traumatic for many of Grumman's roughly 30,000 employees. 
Dan Culleton, a Grumman manager who boasts that his father, sister, brother and an uncle all worked for Grumman, now brings his five-year-old son inside giant Building One to see how F-14 cockpits are built. 
Mr. Culleton worries that "the odds are only 50-50, or even a little less," that his boy will have the chance to continue the family tradition. 
"It's hard for me to conceive of Grumman not building airplanes," he says. 

   The firm's problems really began in the mid-1980s, when it decided against seeking a share of the new generation of fighters envisioned by the Navy in order to concentrate its technical and financial resources on an overriding goal: winning the multibillion-dollar contract to build a replacement for the bulbous-nosed A-6 Intruder, the Navy's only long-range, all-weather bomber. 
But the company isn't among the firms picked for that contract, leaving it without a new line of warplanes when production of its battle-tested but aging models is phased out. 

   The next blow came last December, when Pentagon officials took aim at the A-6 years before Grumman had expected. 
Then, just as the company revved up efforts to protect the A-6, Mr. Cheney came into office and immediately launched a surprise attack on the F-14, the fastest of all U.S. Navy fighters. 

   Suddenly on the defensive, Grumman's lobbyists swung into high gear. 
Peter Oram, head of Grumman's aircraft operations, hurriedly arranged a trip to visit the air commanders of the Pacific and Atlantic fleets, playing off their fears and recruiting them in a campaign to lobby with top brass against the cutbacks. 
Since then, the Navy's leadership has formally appealed Mr. Cheney's proposed cutbacks a number of times -- without any success. 

   Grumman also sought help from prominent former Navy and Marine pilots who over the years have entrusted their lives to Grumman equipment. 
Among the most emotional supporters are Democratic Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, a decorated Marine Corps pilot who flew Grumman planes in Korea before his renowned space exploits, and Adm. Thomas Moorer, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who helped develop the F-14. 

   In weekly meetings organized by Grumman officials on Capitol Hill, New York's congressional delegation maps out strategy. 
Their efforts have been aided by Mr. O'Brien, Grumman's combative chairman, who has flown to Washington to meet with at least 15 additional lawmakers since the spring. 

   A former flight-test analyst who relishes belittling archrival McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s F-18 carrier-based fighters, Mr. O'Brien says bluntly: "I don't see F-18s shooting down any Libyans." 
Mr. Cheney's proposed budget nevertheless earmarks nearly $2 billion a year to continue hefty production of the shorter-range and slower -- but much less expensive -- McDonnell Douglas jets. 

   Grumman's supporters contend that relying on McDonnell Douglas isn't enough. 
Dismantling the F-14 assembly line will hobble the nation's carrier fleet with an acute shortage of front-line fighters in the 1990s, they insist. 
The Pentagon counters that it can quickly develop the F-14's replacement -- a super-sophisticated aircraft called the Advanced Tactical Fighter, or ATF -- and buy it in large enough numbers over the next several years to keep carrier decks filled. 

   But ATF design teams already have been slowed down by two previous budget cuts. 
And many critics, including Pentagon insiders, doubt that the ambitious schedule will be met. 

   Canceling F-14 production without having replacements ready is like jumping out of a tall building "because someone promised to bring a net before you hit the ground," says Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. 
The New York Republican is expected to lead the fight for Grumman during the appropriations process. 

   Traditional coalition politics may yet save the F-14. 
In addition to casting their lot with backers of the jeopardized V-22 troop transport, Grumman's supporters have rounded up support from Virginia lawmakers, who defend Navy planes because the carriers that haul them are built, and many are based, in that state. 
The coalition recently won an important test vote when the House Armed Services Committee retained money for the F-14 and V-22 programs alike -- at the expense of the B-2 Stealth bomber and other high-tech Pentagon projects. 
Grumman happily counts on unwavering support from one committee member, Democratic Rep. George Hochbrueckner, a former Grumman engineer whose Long Island district includes thousands of worried company employees. 
"The issue is larger than the fate of one company," he asserts. 
"We're fighting to prevent a potential disaster for all of naval aviation." 

   Such superheated rhetoric doesn't sit well with many other members of the committee, including its ranking Republican, Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama. 
He dismisses Grumman's plight as a "very parochial issue," noting that New York lawmakers rarely advocate higher defense spending. 
"We hear from them only when it affects their district," he says. 

   Meanwhile, out in the fleet, sailors have more concerns of their own. 
Once-proud Grumman planes increasingly are being relegated to secondary roles after they pass their prime. 
Older models are being converted to tankers used for in-air refuelings -- to keep newer combat aircraft buzzing above the carriers.

   A federal grand jury in Syracuse, N.Y., indicted a Cornell University student on a felony computer-crime charge for the release of the software bug that crippled thousands of computers last year. 

   Robert T. Morris, 24 years old, of Arnold, Md., is the first person to be prosecuted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Justice Department said. 
Mr. Morris, who is on leave from Cornell, faces as much as five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and could be required to pay restitution for the incident. 

   The software virus choked thousands of computers at universities and military bases that use the Arpanet computer data network. 
In the indictment, Mr. Morris is charged with illegally accessing computers at a National Aeronautics and Space Administration computer center; the University of California at Berkeley; Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and other computer sites that aren't specified. 

   Mr. Morris's attorney, Thomas Guidoboni, said his client would not comment on the indictment. 
But he said that "after many months of uncertainty, Mr. Morris accepts this event as a step toward the final resolution of this matter." 
He said Mr. Morris will plead not guilty and contest the charge. 
"He looks forward to his eventual vindication and his return to a normal life," Mr. Guidoboni added. 

   Mr. Morris told friends that he created the virus program but that he didn't intend for it to spread as quickly and destructively as it did. 
The virus raced across the network Nov. 2, replicating itself so rapidly that it forced computers to shut down. 

   Paul Graham, a graduate student in computer science at Harvard University and a friend of Mr. Morris's, said that Mr. Morris is being unfairly used as an example by federal prosecutors eager for their first prosecution under the computer-crime law. 
"He's an honest person with a genuine interest in computer security, and it was an accident the program spread to all those other computers." 

   But computer-industry executives see it differently. 
Maryanne Karinch, a spokesperson for the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, said that "hacking with criminal intent is not a sophomoric prank but a serious violation of the law." 
She said violators "should be punished the same way someone who robs a convenience store should be punished. 
Computer users have a right to security and privacy, and that is what these statutes are designed to protect."

   Amdahl Corp. said second-quarter net income fell 38% to $32.8 million, or 30 cents a share, despite increased revenue. 

   The results were slightly worse than the computer vendor had forecast late last month, when it surprised Wall Street by saying that shrinking profit margins would lead to a 25% to 35% earnings decline. 
At the time, Amdahl said it expected revenue to rise about 20%, but its reported revenue of $470.6 million is only an 11% increase. 
In the year-earlier quarter, Amdahl earned $52.8 million, or 48 cents a share, on revenue of $423.8 million. 
The year-earlier results have been restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split. 

   A spokesman called the results "not terribly out of line with our projections" and said the discrepancies between the forecast and the actual figures reflect "problems inherent in making those kinds of calculations." 
He added that the company "didn't do any worse than we figured we'd do." 

   Amdahl has been hurt by aggressive price-cutting by International Business Machines Corp. Amdahl sells computers and memory-storage devices that mimic those sold by IBM, so it is under pressure to match IBM's prices. 

   A spokesman said profit margins also suffered because sales of its 5990 mainframe computer are making up a larger portion of total sales; the 5990, introduced in May 1988, costs more to make than other Amdahl products. 
He said Amdahl also was hurt by the strength of the dollar against foreign currencies. 

   Amdahl said it expects results to pick up later this year as deliveries of new storage products increase. 

   For the six months, Amdahl earned $78.4 million, or 72 cents a share, down 18% from $95.4 million, or 88 cents a share. 
Revenue rose 19% to $941 million from $791.4 million. 

   In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Amdahl closed at $15, down 62.5 cents.

   Poor women spend a large share of their monthly income on child care, according to the Commerce Department. 

   The Census Bureau reports that working women with monthly incomes less than $1,250 paid an average of $35 weekly for child care, or 18% of their monthly income. 
Women with monthly incomes more than $3,750 paid an average of $58 weekly, or 4% of their monthly income. 

   "There is quite a wide equitable disparity," said Martin O'Connell, chief of fertility statistics at the bureau. 
"Poor women don't have much money coming in, but more going out {for child care}." 

   Of the 5.8 million working women responding to the survey conducted in 1986, 353,000 were considered poor. 

   The survey estimates that in 1986, $14 billion was spent on child care for children 14 years old and younger. 

   Most working mothers utilize child-care services outside the home. 
Of the nine million preschool children in the survey, four out of 10 were cared for in someone else's home, and 21% attended formal child-care facilities.

@  Lord Alexander
@  To Find Outsiders
@  For NatWest Posts

<TEXT>
   Lord Alexander, the new chairman of National Westminster Bank PLC, vowed to hire more outsiders for top jobs and review its investment-banking role after the stock scandal that toppled his predecessor. 

   A sharply critical government investigation of County NatWest, the giant bank's investment-banking unit, triggered the exodus of Lord Boardman, NatWest's chairman, plus two deputy chief executives and a third senior director, although Lord Boardman wasn't cited in the government report. 
The investigation found evidence of misconduct and failure to comply with British company law in County NatWest's handling of a #837 million ($1.35 billion) rights issue for Blue Arrow PLC in 1987. 

   This week's management purge, unprecedented in recent U.K. banking history, has seriously shaken London's financial community and damaged both NatWest's blue-chip reputation and its investment-banking ambitions. 

   Lord Alexander, 52 years old, who takes the NatWest helm Oct. 1, called the Blue Arrow affair "the saddest episode in the history of the bank." 
He said "every activity will be under review" as a result. 
"I do not envisage entrenchment," he told a small group of reporters here yesterday. 
"But an organization that has had an episode such as this should properly look at all aspects of its activities." 

   Lord Alexander may find it difficult, however, to fill the gaps in top management and restore NatWest's tarnished image. 
Though he is Britain's best-known lawyer, he never has managed a business or been a banker. 
His inexperience doesn't bode well "for restoring confidence in NatWest rather quickly," one London banking analyst said. 

   Lord Alexander, currently chairman of Britain's Takeover Panel, a regulatory agency, said his banking inexperience "is one of the reasons I was selected" as NatWest's new chairman. 
Lord Boardman, 70 years old, previously had planned to retire from the #178,320-a-year chairmanship at the end of the year. 
While praising NatWest's existing senior management, Lord Alexander indicated he intends to bring in fresh blood -- including other non-bankers. 
He said he would seek "different kinds of talent that might give rise to a different sort of balance" against the bank's insiders. 
That could spark corporate culture shock. 
Like most major British banks, NatWest traditionally promotes from within, which breeds both fierce loyalty and insularity. 

   Lord Alexander declined to identify which top posts he might fill with outsiders, but said replacing the three departing senior directors won't wait "until I formally become chairman." 
Some analysts think the new chairman also should streamline the bank's top-heavy, 31-member board. 
Changing the board structure "must all be part of the consideration," Lord Alexander agreed. 

   In his planned wide-ranging review, he said he will make sure NatWest remains involved only in activities where it can "offer valuable service." 
But he insisted the bank won't abandon investment banking. 

   A more likely development, some analysts said, would be County NatWest's retreat from securities dealing, while remaining in the corporate-finance field. 
But it has fallen far behind competitors in corporate finance, largely since the investigation of the Blue Arrow affair began last December. 
During the first half of this year, County NatWest handled five deals with a total value of #265 million -- ranking 18th among financial advisers in British public takeovers, reports Acquisitions Monthly, a British publication. 
By contrast, it held fifth place for 1988, advising on 24 transactions with a total value of about #7.3 billion. 

   The Blue Arrow affair "undoubtedly has cast a shadow" over County NatWest, said Lord Alexander, who appeared frazzled after a week of crisis. 
But after the parent bank's management shuffle, County NatWest's relatively new leadership "can seek to restore its reputation and business," Lord Alexander said. 

   Analysts aren't so sure. 
The scandal "has damaged their long-term reputation," said Robert Grant, a banking analyst at Nomura Research Institute.

   In Washington, the poverty debate now centers on one crucial issue: How to blame the other guy. 
The Democratically controlled Ways and Means Committee recently produced a study, smilingly called "nonpartisan," that implicitly blamed the Reagan administration for recent increases in the poverty rate. 
To do so, it had to count 1979 and 1980 as Reagan administration years. 
Then it could show that poverty indeed increased between 1979 and 1987. 
The New York Times ran a front-page opinion piece based on this report and headlined, "Forces in Society, and Reaganism, Helped Dig Deeper Hole for Poor." 

   The Republican Study Committee screamed bloody murder. 
It used the Ways and Means data to show that between 1982 and 1987, years when Reagan budgets were actually in place, real income for those in the poorest fifth of the nation actually increased 4.1%. 
It was in the Carter years, it says, that the poor got poorer. 

   The fuss is all good politics. 
But it has nothing to do with poverty. 
Poverty trends are complex and deep; they simply can't be pegged to inauguration schedules. 

   Here is what really happened. 
Through the postwar era, the number of people living in poverty declined until about 1973. 
Then, remarkably, the poverty rate leveled off and began to increase. 
Since then, it has been fluctuating around a higher plateau. 
The years between 1979 and 1983 were brutal on the poor. 
Since 1984, the situation has been somewhat better. 

   The crucial question really is what happened around 1973 to cause the long decline in poverty to reverse itself. 
That is what honest poverty experts generally debate, some arguing that Great Society programs caused the change, some that the cultural revolution of the 1960s was responsible, others saying there had been a more fundamental change in the U.S. economy. 
Meanwhile it has become nothing short of hilarious to watch the political operatives in newspapers, magazines and on Capitol Hill pretend that troubling poverty trends started with Ronald Reagan. 

   To play their political games, the partisans rely on statistics and categories that are quaintly archaic. 
Back in the '60s and '70s, it was believed that poverty was a problem of scarcity. 
If government could divert resources to the poor, then they would be pushed out of poverty. 
Economists dominated the poverty debate, talking about income quintiles, and amassing data from little green books. 

   With the recognition of the underclass around 1982, it became obvious that behavior, not merely income level, had a lot to do with who was poor. 
Sociologists began to dominate discussion, and a welfare consensus emerged around the need for developing good work habits, sexual self-restraint and individual accountability. 
Even the liberal Ford Foundation has acknowledged that family breakdown is a major cause of social problems. 

   Savvy experts stopped relying on income quintiles because they tell you nothing about how poor people behave. 
When the Ways and Means Committee comes out and focuses on poverty rates and income distribution, it is a bit like watching a 20-year-old rerun of Dick Clark's "American Bandstand." 
It's hard to believe people really talked that way. 

   Here's a hoary old chestnut that stands as the centerpiece of the Ways and Means report: "The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer." 
This formulation has always appealed to envy, but not much to common sense. 
In the first place, it's never been clear what the first observation has to do with the second. 
It is incoherent to pretend that the poor are getting poorer because the rich are getting richer. 
The economy is not finite. 
In fact, members of the working poor usually get richer only when the entire economy, including the rich, does better. 
To introduce the rich into talk of how the poor are doing is merely a lame effort to transform the problem into a pseudo-Marxian class struggle. 

   The more fundamental problem with the saying is that it pretends there is such a thing as "the poor." 
The obsolete economic perspective on poverty picks an income level and then lumps everybody under it as "the poor." 
In reality, 41% of this group own their own homes; many, however, are drug addicts living in the street. 
Some 11% have completed college, but many have virtually no marketable skills. 
Almost 40% of poor families have both parents in the home; the other 60% are female headed. 
The differences are profound, and they have to do with situation, not income. 

   It's time to stop defining poor people by how much they make, and to start defining them by behavior -- by education, by job history, by family status. 
In the 1980s, we have arrived at a more realistic perception of poverty, but statistical measures haven't caught up. 
Until they do, we will be inundated by silly, partisan reports and nonsensical news articles.

   THE HOUSE VOTED to suspend production of the radar-evading Stealth bomber. 

   By a 257-160 vote, the chamber moved to bar output of the plane until the White House agrees to a revision of the $70 billion program, including slashing its request for 132 of the bombers and demonstrating the aircraft's technical capabilities before production can resume. 
The House also voted to temporarily block Pentagon moves to put MX nuclear missiles on railroad cars, removing $502 million for rail gear and extra MX missiles. 

   The Stealth hurdles that would be imposed by the House are significantly tougher than B-2 spending restrictions expected to be adopted by the Senate.

   Hamideh Marafat spent 1979 in what she still refers to as "the nest" -- as in "nest of spies." 
She entered the U.S. Embassy at the request of fellow students who had stormed the premises a day earlier. 
She has never quite gotten over her first glimpse of the huge American kitchens used to prepare the diplomats' state banquets. 

   Ms. Marafat was one of the "Muslim Students Following the Imam's Line" and, 10 years later, she still is. 
Like many of the Islamic revolution's hard core, she is watching closely for signs of deviation from that line following the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
On Friday, she will vote for Hashemi Rafsanjani for president of the Islamic Republic. 
But she isn't without reservations. 

   "Many people are asking how, if the liberals are for Rafsanjani, we can be for him too," says the 29-year-old, who wears a severe black chador over a cowl-like hood, a long tunic and pants. 
Last week, she and her friends took that question to a weekly discussion group led by a young mullah who ardently supports Khomeini. 
"He said that this label of 'liberal' has often been used as a trick, by those who want to divide us," she says. 
"We recognize that Rafsanjani is something different, but we don't see him moving the revolution away from the path the imam has set." 

   For "hezbollahis", or religious revolutionaries like Ms. Marafat, there isn't any question of what will happen if he does. 
She would agree with Ali Akbar, a rug merchant in Tehran's bazaar, who answers the question by harking back to the early days of Islam, when someone asked if Omar -- the second calif to lead Islam after Mohammed -- would follow the prophet's path. 
A man brandished his weapon and said, "This sword will make sure he does." 

   The merchant, Ms. Marafat and many others like them see themselves as continuing the role of this early Islamic warrior, and don't doubt they have the necessary strength. 

   Just how many hezbollahis there are in Iran is uncertain. 
The millions who jammed the streets for the ayatollah's funeral have melted back into ordinary life: The crowd at the graveside for the traditional 40-day mourning ceremony was far smaller, probably numbering in the thousands. 
Gatherings at Friday prayers have returned to around the same size as before the ayatollah's death. 
But there also may be many, like Ms. Marafat, who no longer feel they have to express their zeal on the streets, yet would be prepared to do anything if they saw a threat to their revolution. 

   Ms. Marafat has never questioned the justice of what she did at the U.S. Embassy. 
During much of the 444-day crisis, her job was translating all the mail that went in and out of the building -- the hostages' messages to their families, the letters of Americans writing to the hostages to express their grief and support. 
Many of the letters were abusive notes to Maryam and Habib, the two spokesmen who took turns appearing on the U.S. television networks to read out the students' demands. 
But the letters she remembers best are the numerous notes written by American school children, designed to cheer up the captives. 

   "Sometimes I felt pity for them when I read those children's letters," she recalls. 
"But I knew they were spies who had tried to ruin this country." 

   Working now on the finishing touches to her master's degree in English, Ms. Marafat is a soft-spoken revolutionary who defied her mother to take part in anti-Shah demonstrations, and who had to convince both parents that her work at the embassy wouldn't interfere too much with her studies. 
She has kept track of about 10 of the students who led the embassy seizure. 
Four of them, she says, died at the front during the war with Iraq. 
One has become a provincial leader of the Revolutionary Guards, one has joined the Majlis, or parliament, and the rest, like herself, have quietly pursued academic careers. 

   Unmarried, she lives with her parents in a comfortable house with cool stone floors and Persian carpets. 
Indoors, away from the gaze of men, she discards severe Islamic dress for a smart silk blouse and tan skirt. 
Uncovered, her wavy brown hair bobs stylishly, just above her shoulders. 
Her ambition is to travel to Britain next year to begin work on a doctorate, which she hopes will lead to a teaching post at an Iranian university. 
Then, she says, "I will have to be involved in politics, because it is important for teachers to take positions." 

   For now, though, her daily routine is distinctly non-political. 
It takes her from the classroom, where she teaches English ("Since the revolution, everybody studies well, because there's nothing else to do," she says), to the language laboratory, to standing in line for the family groceries. 

   She is well aware that the Iranian economy is a mess, and she welcomes Mr. Rafsanjani's promises of reform. 
But she is yet to be convinced that restoring relations with the U.S. is justifiable, even in Iran's economic or strategic interest. 

   Her views on the U.S. show the height of the ideological hurdles Mr. Rafsanjani will have to vault if he chooses to move in this delicate area. 
Ms. Marafat is firmly convinced that the U.S. deliberately shot down the Iran Air passenger jet last year and that Iran's war with Iraq was masterminded by the U.S. to deflect aggression from Israel. 
Indeed, U.S. support for Israel is, to her mind, the Great Satan's greatest sin. 
When a Westerner wonders why the Iranian press has termed "heroic" the act of a Palestinian who drove an Israeli bus of a cliff, killing 14 people, Ms. Marafat is astonished by the question. 
"If they are Israelis, they are the enemy," she says. 
"When Israelis attack Palestinian camps, do they consider individuals? 
When Americans bombed Hiroshima, did they distinguish between combatants and civilians?" 

   Her dream, she says, is to visit the battlefront of a great Islamic campaign to crush the Zionists. 
"Israel, as a state, shouldn't exist," she declares.

   West German banks are planning the launch of a new computer-based system for off-floor securities transactions, a bid to catch up with more progressive financial centers elsewhere before the integration of European financial markets after 1992. 

   The banks, which supervise and effectively control West Germany's stock exchanges, have scheduled the Inter-bank Information System, or IBIS, to start operating Dec. 1. 
They hope it will expand and increase the transparency of securities trading outside the official stock exchange hours, 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., one of the shortest trading spans in the world. 

   In its first stage, the system will link subscribing banks and brokers to a central data bank supplying price updates on 30 blue-chip stocks and certain domestic bond issues, based on telephone transactions. 
IBIS rates will be updated by subscribers as trades are made, similar to the Stock Exchange Automated Quotations system in London and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system for trading stocks in the U.S. 

   In a later stage, the IBIS organizers envision a fully computerized market in which deals also are transacted over the system itself at the push of a button. 

   The German Securities Data Center, which is controlled by West German banks, has contracted IBM Deutschland G.m.b.H., a unit of International Business Machines Corp. of the U.S., to design and install the system. 

   Ulrich Gottschalk, a director of the center, said subscriptions to the system will be limited to banks and brokers based in West Germany, including West German subsidiaries of foreign entities. 
Eventually, the network could be extended to foreign trading centers, he said. 
IBIS is to operate every business day from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., the operating hours set for the planned German Futures Exchange to begin operations later this year, reflecting another West German catch-up measure to avoid being eclipsed by other European financial centers. 
The new exchange will offer futures contracts on West German equities and fixed-income securities, as well as a futures index. 
Mr. Gottschalk said IBIS will be shut down during the two-hour period when stock exchanges are open for business. 

   "The purpose of IBIS was to augment regular trading hours with a parallel system, not replace it altogether," Mr. Gottschalk said. 
"A second motive was to supply accurate, after-hours prices as a reference for trading on the new futures exchange." 

   The decision to adopt the system was made by the so-called Council of Experts, a panel of West German bankers regularly advising the supervisory boards of West German stock exchanges, themselves made up of bankers. 
Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG, West Germany's top two banks, were the principal forces promoting the IBIS project.

   National Westminster Bank PLC's chairman and three senior directors resigned in one of Britain's biggest banking management purges, prompted by harsh government criticism of the bank's role in a 1987 Blue Arrow PLC rights offering. 

   The exodus of Chairman Lord Boardman, two deputy chief executives, Charles Green and Terence Green, and a general manager, John Plastow, reflect NatWest's desperate attempt to cope with the government investigation of the bank's underwriting of the Blue Arrow offering. 
But the affair is far from over. 

   NatWest and individuals named in a government report released last week still could face criminal charges stemming from their actions during the underwriting flop. 
The Bank of England has yet to decide whether any individuals are unfit to remain in British banking. 
And British regulators are considering whether to restrict individuals' or NatWest's activities in the securities markets. 

   Lord Boardman's sudden change of heart about resigning highlights the seriousness of the affair. 
Only last Friday, the NatWest chairman -- who wasn't cited in the government report -- said he wasn't contemplating resignation because "the ritual falling-on-the-sword thing" didn't do much good. 
But yesterday, he acknowledged that the Blue Arrow affair has been "very expensive" for NatWest and that "morale has suffered." 
The biggest casualties from the affair are NatWest's blue-chip reputation and its already-stumbling investment-banking aspirations. 
A NatWest spokesman declined to comment on speculation about the future of the bank's investment-banking operations. 

   In the short term, the departures aren't likely to alter the bank's day-to-day operations substantially. 
Thomas Frost, the bank's strategy-setting chief executive, keeps his post; he wasn't criticized in the report. 
And younger managers stand ready to assume greater responsibilities. 
The departing directors all were nearing retirement age. 
Lord Boardman, 70 years old, had planned to retire at year end and be succeeded by Lord Alexander. 
He now will leave Sept. 30. 
NatWest didn't immediately name succesors for the departing senior directors, whose resignations take effect immediately. 

   In an unusual press conference yesterday, Lord Boardman said he objected to certain findings in the government's investigation. 
But he added that he felt he couldn't stay after the three directors resigned. 
"Very serious errors were made in one part of the group," he said. 
"Ultimate responsibility is mine." 

   The resignations cap a string of departures following last week's publication of the highly critical government inquiry into NatWest's handling of the #837 million ($1.36 billion) Blue Arrow rights issue. 
The report found evidence of misconduct and failure to comply with British company law by not disclosing for three months a holding of more than 9.5% in Blue Arrow. 
It cited more than half a dozen current and former NatWest executives, including the three senior directors, "for conduct falling below that to be expected." 

   The Bank of England yesterday said NatWest Deputy Chairman Sir Philip Wilkinson resigned as a member of the Bank of England's board of banking supervision, though he remains at NatWest. 
And Elizabeth Brimelow, a former compliance officer with the bank's County NatWest investment-banking unit, stepped down as compliance director at Charterhouse PLC, though she remains employed by the financial-services group. 
Last week Ms. Brimelow, who was criticized in the government report, resigned as a director of the Securities Association, a securities-industry watchdog group. 

   On Monday, NatWest confirmed that investment banker David Reed quit County NatWest and Nicholas Wells, a former NatWest corporate financier, stepped down from a post at a Barclays PLC unit. 
Both were criticized in the government report.

   Carl N. Karcher, chairman and chief executive officer of Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc., and six members of his family agreed to pay $664,000 to settle insider-trading charges. 

   The preliminary pact with the Securities and Exchange Commission is subject to court approval. 

   The SEC alleged that members of Mr. Karcher's family used advance knowledge of a plunge in profit to sell stock in the Anaheim, Calif., fast-food chain in 1984. 
Mr. Karcher himself isn't alleged to have sold any stock at that time. 

   Under the proposed settlement, Mr. Karcher will pay a fine of $332,000 to the SEC. 
His relatives, whom he allegedly tipped off, will pay a further $332,000, representing losses the SEC says they avoided by selling stock on inside knowledge. 

   According to the proposed consent decree, neither Mr. Karcher nor his relatives will admit or deny the charges. 
Mr. Karcher, who faced fines of as much as $996,000, has declined to make any comment on the agreement, a secretary said. 

   Yesterday, Carl Karcher Enterprises stock slid $1.25 a share, to close at $15.75 in national over-the-counter trading. 

   The current agreement follows an aborted settlement attempt last May that foundered when lawyers for Mr. Karcher and his family sought assurances that no criminal charges would be lodged against them. 
The proposed settlement of SEC civil allegations doesn't contain any such agreement, said John C. Koutsos, SEC counsel. 

   Apparently also in process is a separate agreement with Alvin A. DeShano, the director of accounting at Carl Karcher Enterprises, who in June was acquitted of criminal fraud and insider trading. 
The anticipated pact would settle the SEC's civil allegations against Mr. DeShano. 
The initial case filed by the SEC in April 1988 alleged that 16 people were involved in insider activities. 
Since that filing, six family members agreed to pay back more than $187,500. 
In September 1988, one of Mr Karcher's sons was found to have breached insider-trading laws and was required to repay $10,500. 
Charges against Mr. Karcher's wife, Margaret, were dropped earlier this year.

   Data General Corp. reported an unexpected loss of $23.1 million on flagging sales for its fiscal third quarter, fueling fresh concern for the slowing pace of minicomputer sales. 

   Data General's results set the stage for steep losses forecast by Wang Laboratories Inc. and for weakening results from Prime Computer Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp., expected to report this week. 
Unisys Corp., another major computer maker, reported a 67% drop in net income Monday. 

   "Data General and Unisys have already entered the recession," said Jay Stevens, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
"The big question mark is U.S. sales and orders for Digital," he said. 

   Data General's loss for the quarter ended June 24 compared with net income of $592,000, or two cents a share, a year ago. 
Revenue fell 7.4% to $306.1 million from $330.7 million. 
Weakening domestic demand was a major factor, it said. 

   "In the short term, revenues and earnings remain under pressure from soft U.S. demand and from the negative impact of translation of international currencies into a stronger U.S. dollar," said Ronald L. Skates, executive vice president and chief operating officer. 

   The company had an operating loss of $28.7 million, before a $6.3 million pretax gain from the sale of a plant in California, compared with operating profit of $3 million a year earlier. 

   Data General closed at $17.75 a share, down 50 cents, in active New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   The Westboro, Mass., company is in the midst of a restructuring of its product line, embracing industry-standard Unix software and reduced instruction set computer, or RISC, technology. 
But it must also serve existing buyers of its older computers, which provide the bulk of sales. 
"The decline of Data General's existing proprietary products continue to overshadow the transition to the new Unix-based line," said Barry F. Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.

   Sure, residents here seem to have it easy. 
But they have their problems, too. 
Big problems. 

   There's a servants shortage. 

   The crisis is so severe that so-called friends have been stealing one another's housekeepers. 
Guests are taking servants aside at dinner parties and offering them $500 a week and up to jump ship. 
Agencies are placing servants for big fees, then calling them on the sly with higher offers. 

   In the Platinum Triangle, the ritzy area that includes Beverly Hills, Bel-Air and Holmby Hills, this breach of etiquette is called "maidnapping" -- and it's ruining friendships. 

   Consider the saga of Barbara Mann, co-owner of the Sandra Taylor employment agency. 
She had a wonderful maid named Angela Gomez. 
"She was outstanding. 
I loved the way she was with my children," Mrs. Mann says. 
"I loved her refinement, her class." 

   But when Mrs. Mann returned from a trip East to visit her family, Ms. Gomez was gone. 
No note. 
An empty closet. 
Then, a few weeks later, she saw her close friend, the wife of a well-known director, drive past her house with Ms. Gomez in the car. 
It was the same friend who had taken her to the airport. 
When she called to confront her friend, Ms. Gomez answered the phone. 

   "What are you doing there?" inquired Mrs. Mann. 

   "She no home," responded Ms. Gomez, somewhat enigmatically. 
When Mrs. Mann finally reached her friend, she says the woman claimed that "Angela came to me. 
She wanted to leave." 

   "I call it maidnapping. 
What do you call it?" 
Mrs. Mann angrily asked her friend. 
"I don't want to talk about it," the friend replied, according to Mrs. Mann. 

   Evidently the friend still doesn't want to talk about it. 
When called for comment, the alleged maidnapper's husband answered the phone, confirmed the couple once had a maid named Angela, but then slammed down the phone. 
Mrs. Mann and her friend no longer speak to each other. 

   The servant shortage has been magnified recently by immigration laws that granted amnesty to many illegal aliens. 
Many live-in housekeepers, now becoming legal residents, are suddenly free to find less onerous work outside the mansions. 
Ask Lucy Mires, a Peruvian housekeeper, who just threw down the mop at one palatial estate. 
"This lady likes working me like a slave," Ms. Mires said, shortly before quitting. 
"When I am busy with something, she wants more and more and more. 
Every day I work from eight in the morning until 11 at night. 
It's too much] I'm sorry] This is America]" 

   "It's gotten out of hand, really," says June Scott, a local real estate agent. 
"The help has become very discriminating as to who they want to work for." 

   As market forces change, servants are naturally "trading places." 
Linda Shanedling, the owner of Home Maid Connection Agency, says she recently received a disturbing call from a Polish houseman she had sent to a family here two years ago. 
"Some friends of the family approached him on the side and hired him away," says Ms. Shanedling. 
Actually, she notes, they had their secretary call and offer him $550 a week, up from $400. 
He accepted. 

   All this servant shuffling is changing the social life in the Platinum Triangle. 
Not so long ago, the wealthy liked to show off their household help and well-run homes. 
No more. 
"You never let your maid answer the door," says Herbert Fink, the owner of Theodore, a local clothing shop. 
"It's easier to get a new friend than it is to get a good housekeeper." 

   Dinner parties are fraught with anxiety. 
James C. Katz, the producer of "Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills," a current film about upwardly mobile Beverly Hills servants, says he was at a party for the movie a few months ago when he noticed the hostess peering nervously over his shoulder. 
When he turned, he saw a guest chatting with one of the servants. 
"Just leave it to Phyllis to steal her," snapped the hostess. 
"She has done it before." 

   Obviously, bragging about a great housekeeper is naive. 
Lois Marx, a daughter-in-law of the late Groucho Marx, hired Ubol, a part-time housekeeper from Thailand and helped her to become a citizen. 
"She was a marvelous cook," says Mrs. Marx, who can't recall Ubol's lengthy last name. 
So when a movie producer called and asked about the woman, Mrs. Marx delivered a glowing report. 

   No more Thai cuisine. 
Frances Bergen, the mother of actress Candice Bergen and a friend of the producer, eventually "lured her away," according to Mrs. Marx. 
"She wasn't a close friend but she knew my husband's father was Groucho Marx. 
It was snaky," says Mrs. Marx. 
"The way she did that, she probably felt guilty." 

   Not exactly. 
"I didn't steal her from Mrs. Marx," retorts Mrs. Bergen. 
"The lady in question needed a place where she could live in." 
Indeed, she claims, it was Ubol who suggested the switch. 
Mrs. Bergen says she called Mrs. Marx to discuss the matter first and thought she understood Ubol's need to live in. 
"Mrs. 
Marx hated to lose her. 
I would be sorry to lose her, too," she adds. 
"She is just a jewel." 

   Sometimes the alleged snake is an employment agency. 
Many residents say agencies supply housekeepers, then call when the family is out with higher offers. (The going price ranges from about $200 to $500 a week.) Agencies deny this. 
But Pamela Beck, the author of "Rich Men, Single Women," says she played back her answering machine one evening and found this accidentally recorded conversation with her nanny: "Are you happy? 
Because we can get you another job." 
It sounded like the voice of an employee from the very agency that had supplied the nanny for a $250 fee. 

   "I was just enraged," says Mrs. Beck, who stood listening to the conversation with her husband. 
"The agent was a snake," she says, though she declines to name the agent or the agency. 
The nanny turned the offer down, but Mrs. Beck says, "I could feel her thinking about it." 

   Agencies themselves are desperate. 
Debbie Campos, the owner of Meet My Maids, says, "I'm going nuts. 
Life was a breeze a couple of years ago. 
Now if a client wants a live-out maid I have a million good ones. 
But if they want a live-in maid it's a struggle." 
To recruit maids, she says she now visits churches with immigrant congregations and chats with pastors about her business. 
She even sent her business card to the Guatemalan consulate. 

   Those housekeepers still willing to suffer life with the families of Beverly Hills often have their employers jumping through hoops. 
Many families now pay their housekeepers' school tuition, as well as health and car insurance. 
Servants quarters are being upgraded with big-screen televisions. 
To humor one of his housekeepers, Mr. Fink, the clothier, knocked down a wall to enlarge her bedroom, improved the closets and added a sitting room. 

   "Ten thousand dollars later she was gone," Mr. Fink says with a sigh. 

   Cathy Orell, the owner of Baby Buddies Agency Inc., says a distraught client complained that her new housekeeper refused to make the children's bunk beds. 
"She didn't want to climb on the top bunk," says Ms. Orell. 
"She felt she was too much of a lady to climb." 

   Other housekeepers are adopting the manners of their employers. 
Sandra Moss came home one day and discovered her houseman heading out to her tennis court for a game with his son. 
"I told him he can't play tennis during his workday. 
He told me his exercise is more important," says Ms. Moss. 
"I said I understood that." 
Then, she fired him. 

   Another rude awakening occurred when Jim Roth, a marketing consultant, offered his $24,000-a-year houseman the use of his station wagon. 
"I prefer my BMW," the houseman sniffed. 

   If all of this sounds like a TV sitcom, stay tuned. 
The Manns, the couple who lost Angela Gomez to a friend, say they are negotiating with Warner Bros., a unit of Warner Communications Inc., to create a new series called "Get Help," based on the saga of the maids of Beverly Hills. 
"It's going to show that the true brokers of the rich and famous are domestics," says Robert Mann. 
"Without them, the affluent can't seem to survive."

@  Judges, Immune No More,
@  Seek Malpractice Insurance

   First came doctors, then lawyers, engineers and accountants, and now judges. 
Nearly 3,300 judges nationwide have decided that they, too, need malpractice insurance. 

   "Judges are sued far more often than the public would believe," says Kent Batty, court administrator for the state courts in Wayne County, Mich. 
"And for the past few years, there's been a mounting concern over liability." 

   Judge Phillip J. Roth of the Oregon Supreme Court says, "Judges realize now that one moment they can be on the bench and the next, they're in the pit being defended." 
Judge Roth, chairman of the Judicial Immunity Committee of the American Bar Association, says at least 800 suits are filed against judges each year. 

   On the average, between 250 and 300 insurance claims are filed by judges each year, says Frank Bolen, a partner at Herbert L. Jamison &amp; Co., the West Orange, N.J., insurance broker that handles judicial liability policies for National Union Fire Insurance Co., the nation's largest supplier. 
About 3,000 state judges and 300 federal judges have policies now, he says. (There are many more state judges than federal judges in the country.) 

   Until the mid-1980s, not a judge in the land would have considered buying malpractice insurance. 
Under common law, English judges were guaranteed absolute immunity from litigation related to their judicial duties -- and the immunity extended to the New World. 

   "The traditional rule recognizes that judges operate in a glass bowl and protects them by making the glass unbreakable," wrote Judge Roth in a recent article, "The Erosion of Judicial Immunity." 
Absolute immunity was considered necessary to insulate judges from vexatious litigants. 
For years, suits against judges were "extremely rare," the judge says. 

   In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld judicial immunity in a case in which a judge had granted a mother's petition for her daughter's sterilization. 
After marrying, the daughter sued the judge, claiming a denial of due process. 
In essence, the court ruled that judicial independence was more important than the civil rights of the plaintiff. 
The case, as it turns out, was the high-water mark for judicial immunity. 
In May 1984, the nation's highest court seemed to alter course. 

   That year, the court ruled in favor of two plaintiffs who claimed that a state judge in Virginia had violated their constitutional rights by incarcerating them while they awaited trial for nonjailable offenses. 
The court upheld an injunction against the judge's action and instructed the judge to pay the plaintiffs' attorney fees under a federal statute. 

   That decision, says Judge Roth, "opened the door to litigation. 
It hit judges right where they sit." 

   The Virginia judge ended up paying more than $30,000 in legal fees to the plaintiff. 
The judge was not insured, although she could have been: In 1981, Complete Equity Markets Inc. in Wheeling, Ill., had begun offering policies to judges. 

   Then in 1984, National Union joined the market. 
Its policy for state judges -- the biggest clients -- costs $800 a year for a $1 million policy with no deductible. 
"The judges are covered for acts, errors or omissions in the performance of professional duties," Mr. Bolen says. 

   The policy covers the client's legal expenses in all cases unless the judge pleads guilty to a criminal act or it is proven that he or she intentionally committed a crime. 
It also covers damages and the payment of plaintiffs' attorneys fees in negligence cases related to the judge's duties. 
Federal judges have similar coverage under a different program. 

   In 1984, state judges filed 46 claims with Mr. Bolen's firm, he says. 
In 1985, the number soared to 185 claims. 
Now it has leveled off at 250 a year. 
Mr. Bolen says that a large part of the claims are frivolous "harassment suits," although some do go to trial. 
Currently, he says, a case is pending in which the judge's legal fees have already passed $100,000 and could go to $300,000. 

   Though most judges take out individual policies, some state judges have group coverage paid for by the state. 
The states include Ohio, Vermont, South Dakota and Rhode Island, according to Judge Roth. 
Though Michigan has no group coverage, Mr. Batty, the state court administrator, says all 64 judges in Wayne County have been covered for four years by individual policies bought by the state. 

   The number of federal judges showing interest in the program is growing. 
"The cost of this insurance is relatively cheap for what you get," says U.S. District Judge Frank A. Kaufman of Baltimore. 

   Mr. Bolen stresses that his firm doesn't believe in advertising its judicial malpractice coverage. 
"If everyone looks at judges and knows they're covered," he says, "there's a likelihood of more suits."

   What's an "abyss"? 

   According to research done for Fox Inc.'s film division, many Americans don't know the meaning of the word. 
This caused Tom Sherak to worry, but then he made the best of it. 

   "Remember a picture called 'Apocalypse Now'?" 
Mr. Sherak, Fox's marketing and distribution president, asks hopefully. 
"Tough title, tough title." 
But the name stuck in people's minds. 
"You can use that to your advantage," he says. 

   Mr. Sherak needs all the advantages he can get, because he faces Hollywood's toughest challenge during this now-ebbing summer season. 
His task is to ensure that by Aug. 9 everyone in America is aware that "The Abyss" is a motion picture and is clamoring to see it. 
Fox, a unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., has its reputation -- and upwards of $60 million -- riding on it. 

   The odds are fierce: Conventional film-industry wisdom says that Aug. 9 is too late in the summer to open a blockbuster. 
Even to meet its three-times-delayed opening, special-effects houses and post-production facilities all over town are working feverishly (and on expensive overtime) to finish the picture. 
When it hits the screens, it may give new meaning to the term "wet print." 

   In this extravagant year of record-breaking box-office grosses, Fox so far has missed the party. 
It ranks seventh among the eight major distributors in market share to date; and since Memorial Day, it has watched several studios feast on audiences with a bunch of sequels ("Indiana Jones," "Ghostbusters," "Star Trek," "Lethal Weapon," "Karate Kid") or at least well-known icons like "Batman." 
Walt Disney Co. lacked this edge but compensated by convincing people it had clear alternatives: "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" for safe family viewing; "Dead Poets Society" for adults seeking high-toned fare. 
Fox has released only "Weekend at Bernie's." 

   "The Abyss" has nothing obviously promotable going for it. 
The film hasn't any well-known stars to provide box-office draw. 
Fox believes the public is as dumbfounded about the actors as it is about the title. 
Who are Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, the film's leads? 

   Moreover, most of the picture takes place underwater, a locale considered problematic for two reasons. 
First, it's hard for actors to do much acting zipped up in deep-sea diving gear; second, the most recent underwater movies, "Deep Star Six," "Leviathan," and a low-budget flick called "Lords of the Deep," all gurgled and died in theaters. 

   The film is also long -- two hours and 18 minutes -- and therefore theaters can't schedule shows in neat 2-4-6-8-10 blocks. 

   The final hurdle from a marketing standpoint is that "The Abyss" has no easy-to-explain concept. 
Fox's big hit of last year, "Big," could be fed to audiences in one bite-sized line: "Tom Hanks becomes a 12-year-old." 
In "The Abyss," the plot twists and spectacles that take place at the end of the film can't be given away by the marketers. 

   "It's a love story, very much set in an atmosphere of adventure and suspense," producer Gale Ann Hurd says, trying gamely to sum things up. 

   If there's a star, it's unquestionably director James Cameron, who won admirers for "The Terminator" and made the cover of Time for "Aliens." 
But even these credits present risks. 
While Fox pushes them on TV spots aimed at young male audiences, it omits them when trying to attract women, for fear the female audience will think the film is a science-fiction or horror film. 
In female-oriented commercials, the relationship is stressed: "For him, it was a matter of honor. 
For her, it was a matter of trust . . . " 

   Plagued by production and editing delays, "The Abyss" was originally set for a July 4 weekend release, then pushed back to later in July, then set to "platform" with openings in a few major markets Aug. 2 before "going wide" Aug. 9. 
Now, the luxury of platforming lost, it's simply opening on 1,500 screens across the country Aug. 9. 

   Some might call this fortunate. 
By waiting until after "Batman" and the other summer hits have cooled down, "The Abyss" eluded early summer's heavy traffic. 
Still, Fox is left with precious few weeks to recoup its investment before kids start going back to school. 
"The fountain just shuts off at Labor Day," says the head of one large theater chain. 

   "That's silly," says Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller. 
"The movie business has proven again and again that all conventional wisdom is worthless." 
He cites "An Officer and a Gentleman," which opened in August 1982 -- and ran through Christmas. 

   Another supposed truism is that no movie recovers from a poor opening. 
For a big action/adventure film, it's considered mandatory to play to overflow crowds from the start, so Fox must generate a sense of excitement during the next two weeks. 
The studio is playing host to about 150 reporters at a junket and screening this Friday. 
It ran a "teaser" ad in the New York Times last Sunday for a special Radio City Music Hall showing Aug. 8, trying to create an "event." 
The next day, Fox issued a press release saying the show had sold out in 24 hours. 

   But there already have been false starts. 
A "teaser" trailer that ran last spring was yanked because "it wasn't powerful enough," says Mr. Sherak. 
Then Fox bought two-page ads July 9 in New York and Los Angeles newspapers showing silhouettes of two lovers and the slogan "There's everything you've ever known about adventure. 
And then there's . . . 
The Abyss." 
The ad studiously avoided any mention of water. 
The campaign was yanked. 
Mr. Sherak simply calls it "phase one, to alert the media we're out there" and says new print ads haven't been completed yet. 

   "The Abyss" not only has to open big but also has to have another not-incidental ingredient -- be a good movie. 
"Cameron's very talented," says a rival studio chief, "but this picture's got to be a nine or a 10, not a seven or an eight, or it's in trouble." 

   Consider Fox's own "Star Wars," which opened in 1977 with then-unknown actors, a title the studio felt was too militaristic, little advance publicity and an ad campaign many felt was unfocused. 
"Star Wars" went on to rupture box-office records, of course, buoyed by what research showed was dizzying word of mouth. 
In short, it became an "event." 

   But "Star Wars" also opened big. 
In the 36 theaters where it had its premiere that first weekend, all-time records were set at 34 of them, recalls Alan Ladd Jr., who ran Fox back then. 

   It helped that "Star Wars" producer George Lucas had worked the science-fiction conventions, whose attendees, after seeing presentations about the film, were the first in line opening night. 
Fox, too, has been attending gatherings of hard-core science-fiction fans and has been sending actors and representatives to diving shows, where the underwater technology used in the film will be best appreciated. 

   Much of "The Abyss," was filmed underwater in an abandoned nuclear plant's containment vessel and required new lighting techniques and specially developed technology -- all of which led to endless problems. 
The tank leaked. 
When it did fill up, the water often became murky, leading to prolonged delays. 

   All that made the budget overflow. 
"There's no question that we honestly misjudged the complexity of the production," says Craig Baumgarten, who supervised the beginning of filming for Fox before becoming an independent producer. 

   How much the picture went over budget is hard to determine. 
Mr. Diller says that "The Abyss" was budgeted at $35 million and that it actually cost in the low $40 million range to produce the negative. 
Given the source, that's a conservative estimate that may not include such items as studio overhead and capitalized interest. 
Costs associated with releasing the picture, which include a lot of television advertising, could be at least another $20 million. 

   As of yesterday, Mr. Sherak had spent only about 25% of his television budget, much of it on Fox's owned and affiliated stations. 
The target has been males aged 15-21, and "awareness" among this group has crept up to 56%, from about 27% prior to TV ad-buying, Mr. Sherak says. 
"Want-to-see" is 36%, which Mr. Sherak says is encouraging. 

   Fox will begin targeting female and older viewers during the next two weeks, when reviews begin to come out. 
The one reviewer who was allowed to see it early, Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers, raved so strongly that Fox has gotten permission to use quotations from it. 

   "It's moving nicely," says Mr. Sherak, who admits the next two weeks will be difficult. 
He concludes: "You play with the cards you're dealt."

   Sweden's producer prices fell 0.2% in June from May but were up 8.9% from a year earlier, Statistics Sweden said. 

   The month-to-month drop followed a 0.3% rise in May and a 1% increase in April. 
The decrease was due in part to a 3.2% drop in prices of refined petroleum products. 

   Sweden's import prices fell 0.6% in June from May but were up 6.8% from a year earlier. 
Its export prices fell 0.4% in the latest month because of lower prices for basic metals and engineering products but were up 8.3% from June 1988.

   Placer Dome Inc. and Consolidated TVX Mining Corp. said they will develop the second stage of their jointly owned La Coipa gold and silver mine in Chile for about $276 million. 

   The companies said the expenditure includes about $248 million for a new 16,500-ton-a-day processing plant and $28 million to cover preproduction costs and working capital. 
The plant is expected to be completed by the first half of 1991, raising La Coipa's projected annual output to 200,000 ounces of gold and 16 million ounces of silver. 

   Vancouver-based Placer Dome and Toronto-based Consolidated TVX said they recently completed development of the first phase at La Coipa, allowing initial annual output of about 52,000 ounces of gold and seven million ounces of silver. 
An 1,100-ton-a-day plant, built during the first phase, will be closed once the larger processing plant starts operating. 

   La Coipa is expected to produce about 2.1 million ounces of gold and 142.9 million ounces of silver over a 13-year mine life, at a cash production cost of $178 an ounce of gold or its equivalent. 

   The companies said their development plans at La Coipa are subject to regulatory approval. 
Financing is being arranged through a consortium of banks.

   The Philippines' oil imports, including costs of insurance and freight, rose 20% to $591.4 milllion in the first five months of the year from $494 million a year earlier, the Energy Affairs Office's demand management division said. 

   The division attributed the increase to higher industrial demand as well as the increase in oil prices. 
It said oil consumption rose 15% in the five months to 33.6 million barrels from 29.3 million. 
An analyst in the government division said the average f.o.b. price of a barrel of imported oil was up 61 cents in the 1989 period to $15.81.

   The vice president of the United Mine Workers union was jailed for blocking traffic to a Pittston Co. coal preparation plant. 

   Cecil E. Roberts and 18 other union members were arrested for sitting on the road outside the plant in Russell County, Va. 
Mr. Roberts was taken to Blackford Correctional Center, a Virginia state prison, according to a state police spokesman. 

   UMW members have repeatedly blocked access to Pittston's mines and plants in the union's continuing strike against the Greenwich, Conn., company, which has refused to sign a national labor agreement with the UMW. 

   Meanwhile, the UMW's international executive board will meet today in Duffield, Va., to discuss the union's strategy against Pittston. 
Some miners have called for a national coal strike to support the Pittston miners.

   Emerson Radio Corp. reported that net income for the fiscal first quarter more than doubled and said that second-quarter results also should improve. 

   The consumer-electronics and personal-computer marketer is "cautiously optimistic about the future," said President Stephen L. Lane. 
He added, "We feel good about the year in general, but based on the history of the industry -- the oversupplies that developed -- we decided it's prudent to be cautious." 

   Net for the quarter ended June 30 jumped to $3.5 million, or 10 cents a share, from $1.3 million, or four cents a share, a year earlier. 
The year-ago figure reflects a $199,000 special credit tied to use of tax-loss carry-forwards. 
Sales advanced 35% to $221.2 million from $163.4 million. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Emerson closed at $5.50 a share, up 37.5 cents.

<TEXT>
   Surprisingly, American journalists and policy makers often ignore many of the critical nuances that frequently shape and define the Israeli political process. 
Your July 10 report "Israel's Labor Party Tries to Find a Role" is an example. 

   You offer the expressions of former Israeli Knesset member Abba Eban as the primary basis of the story. 
You neglect, however, to explain that Mr. Eban and his views were rejected by the Labor Party last year when the former foreign minister was passed over for a position in the current Parliament. 

   Labor joined the current coalition with the Likud Party because the alternative was for the party to accept the reality of its decline into a marginal influence within the Israeli political spectrum. 
Both at the polls and in a variety of recent opinion studies, the Israeli electorate clearly has shown its disdain for Labor's policies and the party's socialist leadership. 

   As well, Labor gambled that the powerful finance portfolio would allow the party to win back its former friends and influence through a series of self-serving, politically motivated economic actions. 
Contrary to the early hopes of Finance Minister Shimon Peres, these efforts have served only to intensify the decline of Labor's standing among Israeli voters. 

   If we truly desire to understand the actions of our close Middle Eastern friend, it would be wise to pay less attention to the voices of Israel's naked kings, and give due scrutiny to the nation's current mood and leadership.

   The leading indicator for May, the latest reporting month, stood at 80, well above the so-called boom or bust line of 50 and up from 70 in April. 

   The agency regards any figure above 50 as an indication the economy will continue to expand over the next several months.

   The Confederation of British Industry said its latest quarterly survey of industrial trends found a "sharp fall" in business optimism. 

   Citing slower growth of orders and output, the confederation said investment "is expected to increase much more slowly over the next 12 months." 

   The organization's report warned that the decline in business optimism could damage Britain's ability to compete with other European countries, and said it is looking to the government to curb inflationary pressures over the long term. 

   The report noted that the decline in confidence is the steepest since October 1982, with growth in demand moderating for the fifth consecutive survey. 

   David Wigglesworth, chairman of the confederation's economic situation committee, said, "The fall in business confidence reflects the more difficult economic conditions being experienced by companies." 
He said that in the past four surveys, expectations of new business haven't been realized. 

   "Manufacturers are therefore being much more cautious about future investment plans, and this could be bad news for Britain's ability to compete in the single European market after 1992," he said.

   PSE Inc., an energy engineering concern, expects to report second-quarter earnings of $1.7 million to $2 million, or 18 cents to 22 cents a share, Albert J. Smith, chairman and chief executive officer, said. 

   The results would represent a decline of at least 34% from a year earlier, when net income was $3 million, or 33 cents a share. 

   PSE estimated first-half net at $2.3 million to $2.6 million, or 19 cents to 23 cents a share, compared with $1.4 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier, an increase of at least 64%. 

   Mr. Smith, in an interview, attributed the improved six-month results to closing debt financing on the company's cogeneration power plant in the San Joaquin Valley of California. 
The $58 million joint venture with Dominion Energy Inc., Richmond, Va., will produce electricity and steam, from one fuel source, for a glass manufacturing plant under a 15-year contract. 

   Two years ago, the small engineering firm began a marketing advance into California and the Northeast from its Texas base. 
By 1991, with its new California energy projects, PSE expects to be generating 550 megawatts of electricity from natural-gas fired plants, compared with 470 megawatts of electricity now being produced in Texas. 

   With public utility commissions warring with investor-owned utilities over placing pricey nuclear plants into the consumer rate base, many utilities simply will not build any more power plants, Mr. Smith said. 
"It has left a void and the independent power industry has moved in to fill it," he said.

   Thank you for the very perceptive article "Keeping Faith" (July 14). 
It came as an interesting addition to your July 13 report ("Apple's Coleman, Refreshed, Resumes Career After a Five-Month Breather") on Deborah Coleman (as well as John Sculley). 

   Ms. Coleman's five-month leave, during which she promised to kick her "workaholism" and to pay attention to her physical needs, seems to me closely related to the Rev. Stephen Wing's stress and isolation. 
He too, according to the article, is doing something about it. 

   I hope your readers, whether clergy or businesspeople "go and do likewise." 
One of the worst ads on television is for United Airlines, which shows a harried troubleshooter shooting all over the world to answer problems, despite missing his child's birthday and taking care of himself. 
In my profession this is called a "Messiah Complex." 
Perhaps it has other names in other professions -- but the dangers are the same.

   When you say "consumers are having more trouble believing what stars say in TV ads" ("Marketing &amp; Media" July 5), you miss the point of celebrities in advertising. 

   That consumers say they do not find celebrities credible is not relevant when brands such as Cover Girl makeup, Nike Air-Jordan sneakers and Miller Lite beer have seen tremendous sales growth directly attributable to celebrity endorsements. 

   The issue of credibility is relevant when a spokesperson says, "More people prefer Pepsi over Coke," but when Whitney Houston drinks Diet Coke in a commercial, what difference does credibility make? 
The consumer's attention is caught, a brand image is reinforced and products are sold. 
Where is the message to question? 
I am surprised that anyone can take seriously a consumer-opinion poll about advertising when many consumers still believe that advertising has no effect on their buying habits.

   Some medium of exchange had to be used to construct the facilities, maintain and staff them. 

   As government produces zero the only place the medium of exchange can be extracted is from the people. 

   What the medium of exchange was and how the North Korean government extracts it are topics for another time.

<TEXT>
   Your July 11 article on earthquake potential in the Eastern U.S. brings to mind another quake-related hazard in the East -- a danger not faced by Californians. 

   The same geology that makes California quake-prone also helps contain damage from earthquakes to a reasonably small geographical area. 
Rock strata under California have been so fractured and jumbled that they form a "shock absorber" that dissipates quake vibrations. 
This effect is like hitting a feather pillow, and is why the 1906 San Francisco quake had no great impact outside the Bay area. 

   In the East and Midwest, however, the situation is different -- and potentially more dangerous. 
East of the Rockies, one can trace largely unbroken rock formations for hundreds of miles in a given direction. 
When the next major earthquake strikes the East or Midwest, these rocks could act as long-distance conduits for quake vibrations and carry damage far beyond the epicenter of the earthquake. 
This effect is more like striking a gong than a feather pillow, and could transmit the shock from a "superquake" in the Mississippi Valley (site of the most powerful earthquakes in U.S. history: the New Madrid, Mo., quakes of 1811-12) all the way to the Atlantic shore. 

   Incidentally, I have spent much time in California and have experienced only one earthquake that was strong enough to send me running for safety. 
That one was in Vermont.

<TEXT>
   I read with great interest your May 22 article describing problems many small businesses are experiencing as a result of chronic labor shortages. 
You vividly portray the stress many firms are experiencing and you correctly report the demographic and social trends that portend even greater difficulties in the years ahead. 

   A growing number of businesses, however, have discovered an innovative solution. 
They are going to prison to address labor-shortage problems similar to those cited in the Journal. 
A recent survey commissioned by the National Institute of Justice identified more than 70 companies that are employing prison inmates in 16 states to perform a variety of manufacturing, service and light assembly operations. 
In Arizona and California, inmates work as travel-reservations clerks for Best Western and TWA respectively; in Nebraska and Washington, prisoners sew casual wear for garment manufacturers; in Nevada they make water-bed mattresses; and in New Hampshire, inmates assemble electronic components, which are used in various high-tech devices. 

   These joint ventures suggest that there are opportunities in prison for many kinds of companies. 
Prisoners are readily available day and night, and are eager to perform the entry-level jobs that an increasing number of companies find difficult to fill. 
At the same time, we all benefit when idle inmates become working taxpayers with the means to compensate the victims of their crimes, contribute to the support of their own families, and offset the cost of their incarceration. 

   Prisons may be the alternative source of labor that a growing number of companies are looking for.

   The stunning defeat of the Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's balloting suggests momentous changes have begun in Japanese society. 

   Of the 126 seats at stake, the LDP, which has ruled Japan for the past 34 years, won only 36. 
The Japan Socialist Party won 46, Komeito 10, Japan Communist Party five, Democratic Socialist Party three, and a cluster of smaller parties 26. 
That leaves the LDP with a total of 109 seats, far short of a majority in the 252member Upper House. 

   The outcome makes it most unlikely that the LDP can maintain its single-party rule for much longer -- particularly not in the form that its leaders have insisted is necessary for Japan's political and economic stability. 
Japanese voters are so disenchanted with the corruption spawned by 34 years of uninterrupted LDP rule that they now are willing to experiment with a more pluralistic form of democratic government. 
That judgment will transform the fabric of Japanese political life. 

   But no one should be deceived about the kind of changes that these forces will -- and will not -- make possible. 
Politically Japan must change, but ideologically it may not. 

   A large percentage of the votes cast for the Japan Socialist Party were actually a protest against the scandal-tainted LDP. 
There is little reason to believe Japan's electorate would support the JSP if it tried to move the country far to the left. 

   Thus, even if the LDP were to lose its control over the more-powerful Lower House -- a general election must be called by next summer -- the JSP probably would not tamper with the economic system that has made Japan a capitalist superpower. 
These constraints aside, Japan's political landscape will be quite different. 

   The LDP will be weakened if it continues to formulate national policies in secret, or if it tries to impose new laws in the same manner employed earlier this year to pass an extremely unpopular 3% consumption tax. 
The members of the Upper House will find themselves obliged, finally, to discuss their nation's problems with the representatives of opposing parties in an open and rational manner. 

   As a consequence, the Upper House gradually will move away from the party-oriented form of politics now practiced, and begin to focus on issues. 
And since no single party will be able to impose its will, they all will have to learn how to defend and promote their policies. 
The highly divisive customs of insult and denunciation typical of post-war parliamentary debate will go out of fashion. 

   There are four popular explanations as to why this situation came about: the fallout from the Recruit influence-peddling scandal; the hated 3% consumption tax; farmers' anxiety over liberalization of Japan's markets to agricultural products; and the furor about Prime Minister Sosuke Uno's private habits. 
But other factors also have been at work. 

   Japanese women, long taught to regard political matters as taboo subjects that are the privileged domain of men, have been deeply angered. 
Many of them have started to vote for female candidates who promise to assert what is now being referred to as "women's power." 
The recent comments of one LDP minister about the unsuitability of women in the world of politics -- remarks directed against JSP Chairwoman Takako Doi -- probably persuaded a good number to vote against the LDP. 
The JSP has capitalized upon this trend by fielding a record number of successful women candidates, but it remains to be seen whether the JSP will be able to accommodate the interests of both women and labor, its traditional base. 

   Less obviously, but no less significantly, LDP leaders inadvertently have disproved their long-held claim that Japan's economic prosperity was a direct result of the political stability LDP rule guaranteed. 
Since the Japanese economy is still going strong, in spite of the political instability the LDP has wrought, voters no longer believe that the economy will fall apart without the LDP's stewardship. 
This was confirmed when the Tokyo Stock Market rose 193.9 points Monday, to finish at 34,093 -- even as rumors were spreading about Mr. Uno's impending resignation. 

   Japan's Diet now must decide what to do about the consumption tax, widely viewed as the main cause of the ruling party's defeat. 
LDP leaders probably will move to reform this tax in the Lower House since continued support for it in its current form would mean political suicide. 
But they most likely will do so in the same strong-armed manner originally used to pass it in the first place, without much debate. 
When the new bill they ratify reaches the Upper House, however, it will be discussed and probably rejected. 
If the LDP stays true to form, it will ignore the Upper House and enact the legislation in the Lower House, where it still has an overwhelming majority. 

   But if this scenario plays out, LDP leaders inevitably will contribute to the Japanese voters' desire for a less party-oriented form of politics. 
This will in turn deepen spreading dissatisfaction with the party's long-running attempt to enforce a form of parliamentary government in which the only issues discussed are the ones on the LDP's agenda. 
And within this emerging environment, a more pluralistic form of issue-oriented politics will be regarded as providing the best way to further the nation's strength and recover its damaged politics. 
If the political transformation Japanese voters launched on Sunday proves successful, it probably will work itself out along these lines. 
If it does, the extreme form of social conformity long generated by a lack of pluralism may well begin to break down. 
The end result would be the development of a more-open form of political life. 

   How will this affect Japan's relations with the rest of the world? 

   The Liberal Democrats long have argued that foreign companies have not been successful in penetrating Japan's markets because the Japanese don't want many foreign products. 
Of course, what they don't say is that the Japanese people have not been able to purchase freely foreign-made items, or to do so at prices they would find attractive. 

   But if Japan's political system is opened up, there is good reason to believe that the interests of Japanese consumers finally will be recognized. 
That naturally would ease many of the tensions between Japan and its leading trading partners. 

   Moreover, the fears that Japan's East Asian neighbors have expressed about its continuing military buildup will be allayed if a socialist-centered alliance succeeds in slowing the pace of military expenditures. 
Given the recent lessening of East-West tensions, the Socialists may very well be able to realize this longstanding part of their political platform. 

   Sunday's election, then, did not just mean fewer seats for the LDP; it has important implications for the future of Japan and the world.

   USX Corp. posted a 17% gain in second-quarter net income as higher oil prices and stronger demand for petroleum products offset flat sales and declining operating profit in its steel operations. 

   The company earned $250 million, or 91 cents a share, including gains of $72 million, or about 28 cents a share, from the sale of assets. 
In the year-ago period, USX earned $213 million, or 74 cents a share. 
Sales rose 16% to $4.96 billion from $4.29 billion a year ago. 

   Separately, profit at National Steel Corp., the nation's sixth-largest steelmaker, jumped to $32.4 million from $19.6 million a year earlier, as steel shipments benefited from strike hedge buying and fewer maintenance shutdowns. 
Sales increased to $674 million from $659.3 million for the company, a joint venture of National Intergroup Inc. and NKK Corp of Japan. 

   Both companies are expected to see a second-half softening in the steel sector, reflecting the sluggish automotive and construction markets. 
For its part, National Steel already has noted that it lost 330,000 tons in third-quarter shipments after its steelworkers initially vetoed a labor contract. 
Since then, its steelworkers have approved the pact and National is working to recapture some of those orders, although at lower profit margins. 

   At USX, profit per ton of steel shipped was $53, compared with last year's $70-a-ton level. 

   Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., noted the difficult comparison with the year-ago second quarter when the industry benefited from peak prices and unusually strong demand. 
Since that time, demand and pricing have fallen off, while inflation has hit raw material and labor costs. 

   The steel segment reported operating earnings of $171 million, down 23% from the year-earlier $223 million. 
Sales were flat at $1.6 billion. 

   Still, USX managed to improve its profit per ton from the first quarter's $33 because of increased shipments linked to strike hedge-buying and increased exports. 
Mr. Marcus noted that second-quarter profit per ton was higher than the $45 he had projected and said the improvement was especially impressive given the continued weakness in steel's oil-country tubular-goods business. 

   "USX is running a very tight ship with aggressive pricing," he said. 
Moreover, he said USX's shipments remained relatively strong, as a result of increased exports. 

   However, he said he's not changing his outlook, which shows operating profits per ton of steel shipped dropping 50% for major mills by year's end because of declining volume and a continued squeeze on costs and pricing. 

   Meanwhile, USX's oil operations buoyed overall performance, with strong demand for refined petroleum products and higher average crude prices. 
Operating earnings at the company's Marathon Oil Co. unit more than doubled to $257 million from $119 million last year. 
Even in the disappointing Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. unit, losses narrowed by $3 million, to $13 million. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, USX closed yesterday at $34.375 a share, down 37.5 cents. 

   National Steel managed to avoid the trend of steelmakers this year by topping both last year's second quarter and this year's first quarter results. 
Profit per ton of steel shipped totaled $32 in the second quarter, up from the $22 the year earlier when the company was beset with unscheduled shutdowns from equipment breakdowns. 
Moreover, the second quarter profit per ton of steel shipped was significantly better than the $8 a share in the first quarter of 1989, when the company had several scheduled maintenance shutdowns. 

   In the first six months, USX earned $546 million, or $2 a share, compared with $370 million, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier. 

   National Steel reported earnings in the first half of $42.2 million on sales of $1.33 billion, compared with earnings of $33.2 million on sales of $1.28 billion in the year-ago period.

   The Chicago Board of Trade doubled the amount of margin money traders have to put up to buy or sell its August soybean futures contract. 

   The August soybean contract has been more volatile than normal during the past few weeks, mainly reflecting uncertainty surrounding the number of contracts held by the Italian conglomerate Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A., traders said. 
Ferruzzi's huge holdings of soybeans and July soybean futures contracts triggered a liquidation order from the exchange on July 11 that sent soybean futures prices gyrating wildly. 
The July contract expired last week. 

   Ferruzzi officials won't specify how many August soybean futures contracts they hold. 

   The exchange didn't say why it was raising the margin requirements, although price volatility is most often cited by market participants as a reason for such a move. 
They noted that the margin increase won't have much of an impact on large, wealthy traders, such as Ferruzzi, but smaller speculators may have to trim their positions to stay in the market. 

   The Board of Trade raised its initial, or speculative, margin requirements to $3,000 a contract from $1,500, and boosted hedging, or maintenance, margins to $2,500 from $1,250.

   Embattled Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley dismissed speculation that he might resign, despite recent revelations that indicate he ordered the deposit of $2 million in city funds in a bank that paid him as a consultant. 

   "I'll be around here four years from now as mayor of this city," Mr. Bradley said in response to reporters' questions at the close of a City Hall news conference on another subject. 
The remark represented a departure for the mayor, who has refused to comment on city, state and federal investigations into his financial dealings. 

   In testimony before the City Council earlier this week, a city auditor disclosed that officials in the city treasurer's office had doctored a document that indicated the mayor had requested the funds be transferred to Far East National Bank, a Chinatown bank that had paid him $18,000 as a consultant. 
A reference on the document saying "per the mayor" was covered with correction fluid, and the name of City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg was written in its place. 
Mr. Bradley said he knew "nothing" about the doctored documents. 

   The mayor has acknowledged that he discussed the city's ties to Far East with Mr. Rittenberg, but has denied that he directed him to deposit the funds there.

Even the most optimistic analysts have expected the company to barely break even in this arena, though Boeing hinted earlier that it might be able to begin turning things around by the end of 1989. 

   Boeing also said it is worried that suppliers won't be able to keep pace with its brisk jetliner delivery schedule. 
Some 60% of 747 deliveries in 1989 are now slated for the fourth quarter. 

   Boeing profit rose to $195 million, or 85 cents a share, from $160 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales soared 7.3% to $5.1 billion from $4.7 billion. 

   Analysts cautioned that Boeing has a penchant for understating good news and playing up bad. 
"They're terminally dour," said David Smith, who researches the company for Raymond James &amp; Associates Inc., a St. Petersburg, Fla., brokerage firm. 
"You never want to let the airlines know you're doing well, or they'll come and pinch you for another half-percent." 
Labor negotiations, he noted, also begin soon. 

   Yet the company's concerns, highlighted by Chairman Frank Shrontz in a statement, are real enough. 
Several key Pentagon programs that Boeing is involved with, including the B-2 Stealth bomber, the Space Station and the V-22 tilt-rotor transport, are now under fire as Congress grapples with the federal deficit. 

   And analyst John Simon said that on a visit to Boeing a week ago, he found 27 747 jets "sitting around waiting for parts." 

   Boeing's results, in many respects, are a perfect encapsulation of the state of the aerospace industry: things booming on the commercial side, to the point of straining manufacturing capability, while money made on the military side continues to dwindle. 

   A number of defense contractors, including Lockheed Corp., General Dynamics Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Northrop Corp., have been squeezed in the first half by overruns on fixed-price research and development contracts. 
Just this week, moreover, Honeywell Inc. announced it will reduce its dependence on weapons sales as part of a restructuring. 

   And Boeing, which is bidding for work on the Advanced Technology Fighter and has numerous other Pentagon pacts, is no exception in feeling the strain. 
Said Mr. Simon: "Boeing's been one of the leading defense contractors for years, and even they can't make money at it." 

   Still, Mr. Smith noted, underneath all the gloom rests the fact that the company's earnings are headed higher still -- a situation he believes bodes well for the company's performance on the New York Stock Exchange. 

   In Big Board trading yesterday, Boeing's shares fell to $52.125, down 37.5 cents. 
But Mr. Smith, one of the most bullish Boeing analysts around, has tracked a close correlation between the company's earnings performance and it share price. 
"There's a lot more room for this stock to grow," asserted Mr. Smith, who predicts the company's earnings won't peak until 1994. 

   In the first half, net was $356 million, or $1.55 a share, on sales of $9.1 billion. 
That compares with net of $296 million, or $1.29 a share, on sales of $8.4 billion a year ago. 
The company reiterated its projection that 1989 sales will be about $22 billion.

   Norfolk Southern Corp. said it plans to donate its century-old Hotel Roanoke to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University for use as an academic and convention center. 

   The 385-room hotel will be closed Nov. 30. 
Downtown development plans call for spending about $30 million to upgrade the hotel. 

   At the same time, Norfolk Southern said it plans to build an office building in Roanoke to house about half of the 3,000 or so employees in the area. 
Price of the new building hasn't been established. 
It is expected to be completed in about two years. 

   A Virginia Polytechnic spokesman said the college hopes to find a private partner to renovate the property and jointly manage it. 
The property would become a conference center as well as housing certain graduate and continuing education programs and a hotel/restaurant management program. 

   Virginia Polytechnic is located in nearby Blacksburg, Va. 
Norfolk Southern, a transportation and energy company, has its headquarters in Norfolk, Va.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) </GV>
<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators said the Internal Revenue Service ignored several reports of wrongdoing among high-ranking employees during the past few years in an effort to protect its public image. 

   The allegation follows a yearlong investigation for the House Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee, focusing on eight cases involving 25 senior officials in 10 offices across the country. 

   The subcommittee investigators, Leonard Bernard and Richard Stana, told the panel at a hearing yesterday that the cases range from personal trips on the agency's tab to the release of confidential tax information from an IRS official to a businessman who gave the official theater tickets and other gratuities. 
In another case, the agency's top criminal investigator in Los Angeles helped develop a tax case against the owners of Jordache Enterprises, a jeans manufacturer, based on information from the founders of Guess Inc., who were involved in bitter civil litigation with the Jordache owners. 
The official then said he was leaving the IRS to work for Guess, although ultimately he didn't take the position. 

   Only one individual in the eight cases was punished within the agency and no one has been prosecuted, the investigators said. 

   The IRS says that many of those involved have retired from the agency and thus can't be penalized administratively, but that most of the cases have been referred to the Justice Department for possible prosecution. 

   But subcommittee Chairman Doug Barnard (D., Ga.) said, "Our investigation indicates that there are serious employee integrity problems among senior managers at the IRS; inadequate internal investigations and punishment of senior-level misconduct; a pervasive fear at all levels of the IRS over retaliation for the reporting of such misconduct; and a driving concern that publicly exposing wrongdoing by senior managers will tarnish the agency's public image and make its tax enforcement responsibilities more difficult." 

   The subcommittee is taking a hard look at how the IRS polices itself and is preparing recommendations to make it more accountable to outsiders. 

   "Wrongdoing by IRS senior managers is too often ignored entirely or ineptly investigated, resulting in a clearance for the wrongdoers," the investigators said in a report submitted to the subcommittee. 

   One of the cases at the heart of the committee's inquiry involves Ronald Saranow, the former head of the Los Angeles office's criminal investigation division. 

   In March 1985, the investigators say, Paul, George, Armand and Maurice Marciano, founders of Guess, went to Mr. Saranow with evidence of tax fraud against Joe, Ralph and Avi Nakash, owners of Jordache. 
At the time, the Marcianos were deep in litigation trying to regain the 50% of Guess they had sold to the Nakashes a few years earlier. 
By the end of 1985, the investigators told the committee, Mr. Saranow was negotiating for a job at Guess. 
In 1986, he asked for an unpaid leave from the agency to go to work for Guess. 

   The congressional investigators, who disparaged the evidence the Marcianos provided, charged that the agency's internal investigation of Mr. Saranow's alleged conflict of interest was sloppy, ignoring some important witnesses. 
The investigation, they said, was headed by an employee who had a "close personal relationship" with Mr. Saranow. 

   Mr. Saranow, who couldn't be reached for comment yesterday, left the agency before the IRS finished its investigation. 
He never went to work for Guess.

   Morton Downey Jr., stung by the cancellation of his talk show because of a lack of advertising, announced a variety of plans. 

   Mr. Downey said he will host a daily, "unabrasive" 2 1/2-minute radio spot to be syndicated by a newly formed company. 
He said he will star in a proposed comedy -- about a country singer with three daughters -- that might be sold to local stations next year. 
And he hopes to sell a one-time TV special based on the song-and-talk show he performs in Atlantic City, N.J. 

   None of this could be confirmed with other sources. 
Mr. Downey said he is working with a new company said to be a unit of Genesys Real Estate, based near Orlando, Fla. 
No one there could be reached for comment. 
Genesis Entertainment Inc., which syndicates the family series "Highway to Heaven," said it isn't involved with Mr. Downey. 

   The host of "The Morton Downey Jr. Show" garnered national notoriety -- and sent advertisers running for cover -- by yelling into the faces of his guests and for other forms of combat, on camera and off. 
Mr. Downey refused to blame his producers or advertisers for his show's demise. 

   "There were people who thought this was a pretty obnoxious way of doing things. 
Maybe they're right," Mr. Downey said of his talk show, which ends in September. 
He added: "But to millions who watched, I was Mr. Popular, and to some I was a hero."

   Short interest in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks grew only 0.9% as of mid-July, primarily because investors aren't betting on further sizable declines among big OTC technology stocks. 

   The overall increase on the OTC market, however, contrasted with the recent declines in short interest on both the New York and American stock exchanges. 
On the Big Board, short interest dropped 8.35%; it slipped 0.89% on the Amex. 

   Although many analysts and investors are unsure about the outlook for stocks in computer-related industries, and prices of many of those issues have declined in recent weeks, short-selling of OTC technology stocks wasn't nearly as heavy as it was last year when similar conditions prevailed. 

   Michael Murphy, who edits newsletters on short-selling and on technology issues in San Francisco, said the reason is that short-sellers don't view the group as overpriced. 
"The valuations just aren't excessive, compared to the rest of the market," Mr. Murphy said. 
"So, even though the outlook may be shaky, {with} the stocks already down, the opportunity to make money on the short side is reduced." 

   Among the largest OTC issues, many of which are stocks of high-technology companies, short interest fell 0.7%. 
In the same period in 1988, it rose 5.9%. 
Stocks with big short-interest declines as of mid-July included technology issues Apple Computer, Intel, Sun Microsystems, McCaw Cellular Communications and Novell. 

   Typically, short-sellers bet that a stock's price will fall. 
They sell borrowed stock that eventually must be replaced, aiming to profit by replacing it with stock purchased later at a lower price. 
Short interest is the number of shares borrowed and sold but not yet replaced. 

   Nasdaq stocks that showed a surge in short interest included Daisy Systems, an engineering systems issue. 
Short interest in it rose 32.5%, or 449,201 shares, to 1.8 million shares. 
Digital Microwave, a microwave radio and fiber-optics concern, saw its short interest rise 267,229 shares, or 19%, to 1.7 million shares. 

   Short interest in First Executive, an insurer that is a large buyer of junk bonds, rose 35%, or 324,566 shares, to 1.3 million. 
Mr. Murphy said many short-sellers are flocking to issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market, including First Executive. 
Many analysts have said that if the economy goes into a recession, there could be a wave of defaults among these high-yield, high-risk debt issues. 

   Although heavy short-selling is generally regarded as a bearish sign for stocks, it can be interpreted more positively on the grounds that shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying. 
In addition, changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage. 
For example, an investor may seek to profit during some merger situations by buying stock in one company involved and shorting the stock of the other. 

   The National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq computer system on which 5,200 OTC issues trade, compiles short interest data in two categories: the approximately two-thirds and generally biggest of the Nasdaq stocks that trade on the National Market System and the one-third that aren't a part of the system. 

   The rise in OTC short interest in July resulted from a surge in short-selling of the smaller stocks. 
In non-NMS stocks, short interest in 1,335 of those issues totaled 47.2 million shares, compared with 44 million shares in 1,268 securities in June. 
This represents 1.31 days' average trading volume, compared with 1.11 days a month earlier. 

   Short interest in 2,406 National Market System securities totaled 173.2 million shares as of mid-July, down from 174.5 million shares in 2,390 issues in June. 
July short interest in these issues represents 1.94 days' average trading volume on the system for the reporting period, compared with 1.69 days the previous month. 

   The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of July 14 or in which there was a short position change of at least 25,000 shares since June 15.

   Travel Industry 

   Gets More Businesslike 

   BUSINESS TRAVEL is really taking off. 
Twenty-four percent of trips taken last year in the U.S. were for business reasons, up from 19% in 1983, according to the U.S. Travel Data Center. 

   The share of pleasure trips remained stable, at 69%, while the share of trips for such things as weddings and family emergencies dropped to 7% from 12%. 

   The demographic characteristics of business travelers are somewhat different from those of pleasure travelers. 
Business travelers are more likely to be men, 61% compared with 50% of vacation travelers. 

   Because business travelers are concentrated in the 25-to-44 age group, they are slightly more likely than pleasure travelers to be married and have children. 

   The biggest differences between business and vacation travel show up in the trips themselves. 
About 43% of business trips involve air travel vs. just 19% of pleasure trips. 

   In addition, the average business trip is longer in distance than the average pleasure trip -- 1,370 miles vs. 950 miles. 
At the same time, business trips are shorter in duration, averaging 4.4 nights, compared with 5.2 nights for pleasure trips. 

   Two-thirds of business trips involve hotel stays, compared with only 39% of pleasure trips. 
And business travelers are twice as likely as vacationers to use a travel agent's services, 20% compared with 11%. 

   Business travelers are human, too. 
Nearly half combined business and vacation on at least one trip last year. 

   Couples Without Kids 

   Most Apt to Own Homes 

   IF YOU THOUGHT the typical homeowner was married with children, think again. 

   Census Bureau survey data show that 32% of U.S. homeowners are married couples with related children under 18. 
But 37% are married couples without any kids living with them. 

   The disparity is partly because there are more couples without children than with children, 26.3 million vs. 25.5 million. 
But it's also due to the fact that couples without kids have a higher homeownership rate, 82% compared with 74% for those with children. 

   Many of these couples without children are older empty-nesters, rather than young couples starting out. 

   Overall, 64% of American households are homeowners, according to a 1988 Census Bureau survey. 
Married couples, regardless of whether they have children, lead the pack, with an ownership rate of 78%. 
Men who head families on their own follow, with 58% owning homes. 

   All other types of households have homeownership rates of less than 50%. 
Only 45% of women who head families by themselves own a home. 
This is even lower than the 47% ownership rate for people who live alone, many of whom are older widows. 

   People who live in other nonfamily households, such as unmarried couples and college roommates, are least likely to own homes, with a rate of 31%. 

   Family Types Vary 

   In Education, Income 

   NOT ALL MARRIED couples with children are the so-called traditional family of yesteryear. 

   The prevalence of divorce and remarriage in contemporary America has given rise to a growing number of reconstituted, or blended, families, and there are major differences among them. 

   Jeanne Moorman of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Donald Hernandez of the Census Bureau found that couples who have only biological children are the largest group of two-parent families -- 79%. 
These parents tend to have more education and higher incomes, and most have been married only once. 

   Adoptive parents are similar to biological parents in education and income, but are a much smaller group -- just 2% of couples with kids. 
They also are a little older than biological parents and have been married longer. 

   The 2% of couples with both biological and adopted children are slightly less educated than purely biological or adoptive parents, and on average, have more kids. 

   As for couples with stepchildren, they tend to be younger and to have lower educational and income levels. 
Couples with both biological and stepchildren are the youngest parents of all. 
They also are the least educated and have the smallest incomes. 

   Odds and Ends 

   ONE OUT OF FIVE American wives is better educated than her husband, according to a 1988 Census Bureau survey. 
In 26% of married couples, the husband is better educated. 
In 54%, both spouses have the same level of education. . . . 
Teen-age acne notwithstanding, the average age of patients who visit dermatologists is 41, according to a 1985 survey from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
And perhaps in anticipation of midlife crises, the average age of psychiatric patients is 39.

   International Business Machines Corp. canceled a major disk-drive product announcement scheduled for yesterday, an embarrassing move that dims IBM's short-term outlook. 

   The computer giant contacted customers in the past few days after running into last-minute technical problems that could delay the products until at least early next year, consultants said. 
That will hurt, because growth in IBM's huge disk-drive business has slowed this year as such competitors as Amdahl Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and Storage Technology Corp. have caught up with IBM's technology and waged a price war. 
The new high-end products would have put IBM safely back out in front. 

   Market researchers had predicted IBM would generate some $5 billion of revenue from high-end disk drives this year. 
Thomas Donovan, an analyst at IDC Financial Services, said $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of the $5 billion had been expected to come from the new products. 
He said that IBM has been telling customers that it may still be able to ship the disk drives in volume this year, but that he thinks they may not be available until 1990. 

   "Any time a major company pulls an announcement at the last minute, after they've invited analysts (to briefings) and lined up hotel rooms, you know there's a major problem," he said. 

   An IBM spokeswoman, while confirming that the announcement had been pulled, wouldn't explain what caused the problems or say when the products would be available. 

   Steve Cohen, a securities analyst at SoundView Financial Group Inc., said IBM is putting together an interim marketing plan, "and you don't put one together if you're just going to have a 30-day slip." 
He said that even if customers continue to buy from IBM, the profit margins on the existing products are much lower than they would have been on the new ones. 

   It isn't surprising that IBM would have trouble with the technology. 
High-end disk drives, which are hooked up to mainframes, use phenomenally complex technology. 
Moreover, the new products are expected to store three times as much as current drives while operating at much faster speeds. 

   What's surprising is that IBM didn't catch the problem earlier in its testing program. 
IBM knows how treacherous disk-drive technology can be. 
In the early 1980s, the company had disastrous delays after announcing some disk drives. 
More recently, IBM went through a long delay before shipping the current generation of controllers used with the disk drives. 

   This year, IBM has also gone through some well-publicized mainframe manufacturing problems, as well as problems in making personal computers and low-end disk drives. 
Together with the latest problem, those incidents have some analysts wondering whether IBM didn't lose too much expertise through an early retirement program and whether it hasn't dispersed decision-making a bit too much. 

   Separately, IBM announced an unusual agreement under which it will build and operate a data center for Eastman Kodak Co. 
The IBM operation will take over the work done by four Kodak centers, and 300 Kodak workers will become IBM employees. 
Kodak will continue to develop its own software applications and plot its own strategy for information services, but said it hopes to cut costs as much as 50% by turning the operation over to IBM. 

   David E. McDowell, an IBM vice president, said such an arrangement doesn't necessarily make sense for all companies. 
But he said that "if we've accomplished anything, I hope, it's that we've demonstrated how far we'll go" in putting together a solution for a customer. 

   IBM also said it has four-megabit memory chips -- the latest generation of DRAMs, or dynamic random access memory chips -- available on memory add-in boards for PS/2 personal computers. 
IBM has been the leader in this technology, even though Japanese companies dominate the market, and the announcement is a technological milestone. 
At the same time, IBM's list prices -- at around $900 a megabyte of memory -- were not aggressive, so the announcement is likely to have little effect in the market soon. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, IBM shares fell 75 cents to close at $112.75.

<TEXT>
   On a sweltering day last summer, 10,000 employees of the conglomerate Grupo Industrial Alfa S.A. thronged a baseball field for an elaborate outdoor mass. 
Presiding were a dozen priests and the local archbishop, who read a telegram from the pope. 
Mexico's biggest private company was giving thanks for what seemed a miracle. 

   Weighted down with massive debt, Alfa, after seven years of intense negotiations with 134 foreign banks, had succeeded in slashing its burden by more than half. 
The company was hoping to resume growth after what had been virtually a lost decade. 
"We end a period of great trial and uncertainty," Alfa chief executive Rafael Paez told the crowd, "while we begin another of hard work and hope." 

   One year later, Alfa's prayers seem to have been answered. 
In 1988, the company recorded the most profitable year in its history. 
Exports are growing as never before: steel-making technology to India, petrochemicals to Japan, auto parts to Detroit. 
Alfa has done so well, in fact, that its family owners were able to buy back much of the equity they had surrendered to banks and pay down even more loans; debt now is down to less than one-seventh of the $2.7 billion owed in 1987. 

   While the government of Mexico struggles, managing to negotiate a debt-relief plan but one that will probably reduce its principal very little, the country's private sector is having much better success in getting out from under debt burdens. 
Since 1982, the Mexican private-sector debt has fallen to just a few billion dollars from around $20 billion. 
In the same span, the Mexican government's debt has swollen to $81 billion from $52 billion. 

   And a similar pattern is evident elsewhere: The private-sector debts of Brazil and Argentina have also fallen sharply while the two countries' governments have become further mired. 
"Throughout Latin America, amounts of debt reduction conceded by the banks were significantly greater in the private sector than they were in the Mexico deal," says Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University. 

   Latin American leaders complain that banks haven't yet accepted reductions on public-sector debt because they're more likely to get a taxpayer-funded bailout on public debts than they are on private ones. 
Also, any concession creditors grant to one debtor nation would set a precedent for all the others. 

   But bankers have maintained that the Mexican government simply isn't as deserving of debt reduction as the reform-minded private sector. 
Even some Alfa officials feel the government could do more; "the private sector got out of the crisis first because it made economic adjustments that cut much deeper than those the government was willing to make," says Alejandro Cumming, one of Alfa's outside directors. 
Since 1981, Alfa has nearly halved the number of its divisions and employees, has sacked several family board members and replaced them with respected businessmen, and has imposed stringent production standards that made it internationally competitive and raised exports fivefold. 

   In any case, at a time of third-world economic gloom now brightened somewhat by the bank agreement with Mexico, the turnaround at Alfa suggests what is possible for a seemingly destitute debtor. 
And Alfa's case is more than merely illustrative; Mexico, trying to make a fresh start through a market orientation, is counting on its private sector to be the new engine of economic growth. 
No private company is more important to Mexico's hopes than Alfa, a sprawling company whose 1988 revenue of $1.85 billion amounted to 1.3% of the country's gross domestic product. 

   "It's been a long painful process, but we've learned our lesson: You have to be lean and efficient," says Bernardo Garza Sada, the company's chairman. 

   The Alfa story began almost a century ago in a red-brick brewery run by two brothers-in-law, Isaac Garza and Francisco Sada. 
The brewery expanded vertically, producing everything from the glass for its bottles to the grain for its brew, and then branched out into steel. 
In 1974, the founders' heirs split the company into two firms, Alfa and Grupo Industrial Visa (which went its own way). 

   As Mexico emerged as an oil-producing power in the 1970s, Alfa symbolized the country's go-go spirit. 
Launching an aggressive diversification program, it swallowed up resort hotels on the Pacific coast, bought an interest in Mexico's only private television network, and went into manufacturing ventures in everything from industrial steam turbines to mopeds. 
Assets, revenue and profits all more than quadrupled between 1976 and 1980. 

   But as the size of the company was growing so was the debt load, and meanwhile earnings of many of the new units were stagnating. 
"No one noticed then, but it was a false prosperity," says Guillermo Barba, director of Alfa's food operations. 
When the collapse of oil prices provoked two steep peso devaluations in 1981 and 1982, the dollars needed to service foreign debt became seven times more expensive. 
Alfa's equity was wiped out. 

   Leading Alfa's roll of creditors were Citibank and Continental Illinois (now Continental Bank), each owed $100 million. 
In December of 1981 Alfa called an emergency meeting with bankers to inform them of its crisis -- the same sort of debt squeeze that would envelope the Mexican government nine months later. 

   Many bankers were angry at Alfa, claiming they had been given misleading earnings projections that led them to lend more than they would have otherwise. (Alfa says the situation deteriorated so rapidly that it was hard to make accurate projections.) Nevertheless, Alfa immediately took a tough negotiating stance, suggesting to bankers why Mexicans sometimes call the businessmen of Alfa's home city "the cheapskates of Monterrey." 
When Alfa and other indebted Monterrey conglomerates began pressing banks for strikingly similar terms, bankers added an appellation of their own: the "Monterrey debtors' cartel." 
Alfa's relations with the banks would reach their nadir when the company pulled out of a tentative debt restructuring that had taken months to negotiate, saying falling oil prices changed the economic outlook too much. 

   While negotiations moved at a crawl, Alfa acted urgently to overhaul its inefficient operations, selling off manufacturing ventures in television sets, bicycles and tractors. 
It reduced the bloated corporate staff to 400 from 3,000, cut its work force in half to 25,000, tightened up on working capital and cut energy use in its steel division by one-third. 
Alfa even eliminated most of its subsidy to the Alfa Cultural Center, a major Mexican museum, by levying an admission fee and installing money-making gift shops and cafeterias. 

   It got help from the government too, in the form of an emergency $250 million loan, an easing of price controls, and a program that protected indebted companies from currency devaluations. 

   Alfa also saw that it had to strengthen money-losing operations, such as its food division, which sells processed meats. 
In the boom days, proud Alfa would never have considered marketing its products in Mexico's ubiquitous mom-and-pop stores, or "changarros." 
But now Alfa makes them a priority. 

   In one tiny, concrete-block store in a working-class neighborhood of Mexico City, Alfa salesman Alejandro Palapa stands silently hearing the owner's litany of complaints about her health, the weather and the government. 
But Mr. Palapa's patience has its reward. 
The woman not only buys several Alfa meat products, but allows Mr. Palapa to festoon the store's battered walls with Alfa advertisements. 

   "In a depressed economy even the smallest sales are important," says Mr. Palapa. 
These days, meat sales to the once-ignored changarros in Mexico City average 1,600 tons a month, and sometimes exceed sales to supermarket chains. 

   To earn dollars, Alfa also has made an all-out push to promote exports from subsidiaries such as Nemak, a maker of auto cylinder heads. 
Nemak's quality controls once were so weak that one in five cylinder heads it made wound up on the scrap heap, and at the start of the debt crisis Alfa's lenders pressed for liquidation of the subsidiary. 
Alfa resisted, knowing, as Nemak director general Manuel Martinez recalls, that "we had a big, big market if we could improve the product." 
Partner and customer Ford Motor Co. agreed, gave Nemak a loan to keep it going, and soon Nemak was able to hire some Italian quality-control experts to whip the factory into shape. 

   Now, foundry workers nimbly unload the red-hot, newly forged cylinder heads from a huge rotating turntable at a rate of precisely one per minute. 
"This is like doing a dance -- you have to have the rhythm just right," says Angel Francisco, a worker who barely sweats in the 100-degree factory heat. 
Nemak workers have gotten the choreography down so well that the scrap rate has fallen to less than 1%, and the unit's exports will total $85 million this year. 
Similar improvements in Alfa's petrochemical operations have pushed exports to $280 million from $40 million in 1980. 

   Turning around its operations gave Alfa the wherewithal to win its war of attrition with creditors. 
In late 1986, Alfa reached preliminary agreements to swap debt for equity in its holding company, its steel unit and its food division. 
In the largest of the three transactions, the holding company gave up $25 million in cash, $200 million in Mexican government debt and 45% of its equity to the banks, which, in turn, agreed to slash Alfa's debt to them to $200 million from $1.02 billion. 
For each dollar of debt, the banks ended up with 22 cents and a portion of a share in Alfa. 

   Some feared a glitch, and rushed to the secondary market to sell their rights to a payment and stock. 
They got the 22-cent payment up-front, but surrendered their shares for nothing. 
These banks came to regret their haste. 
Just a few days after the restructuring deal finally closed in December 1987, the Mexican government stopped gradual devaluations of the peso. 
The move, which caused the peso's value to increase against that of the dollar in relative terms, worked to the advantage of companies such as Alfa that had debt in dollars. 
And Alfa was further strengthened by a surge in international petrochemical prices, as well as by government-granted increases in steel prices. 

   Much faster than even its own executives had expected, Alfa was back on its feet. 
In 1988, operating income was a record $425.1 million. 
Special gains related to the debt restructuring and the fixed exchange rate added $574.8 million more. 

   Thus, last May, Alfa wasn't greatly strained to pay $220 million to the banks for 27% of the holding-company equity -- especially since the buy-back price was 38% below the stock's book value. 
Banks that had hung on until May recovered about 60 cents for each dollar they had lent. 
Some banks are still holding Alfa stock, and are glad of it. 
The stock that some banks judged worthless less than two years ago has soared more than 800% since the restructuring was completed. 

   Not all the strategies Alfa used are feasible for an indebted central government such as Mexico's. 
Drastic public sector belt-tightening risks the kind of upheaval that recently erupted in Venezuela and Argentina following government austerity programs. 
Mexico has made distinct efforts to become more efficient, but Miguel Mancera, the governor of its central bank, says that "for the public debt to have been diminished along with that of the private debt, it would have been necessary to run much larger {budget} surpluses, which implies even further sacrifices by the Mexican population." 

   Mr. Cumming, the Alfa director, agrees. 
"Businessmen don't have to worry about politics when they're running their companies, but governments do," he says. 

   The independent-minded people of Monterrey have hailed "the Mexicanization" of their home-town flagship. 
But Alfa chairman Garza Sada isn't letting himself get carried away. 
"The debt crisis doesn't end completely for Alfa until it ends for Mexico," he says. 

   Nevertheless, reducing the passive investment of the banks has already given Alfa new operating flexibility. 
The company now has more room to attract productive foreign investments without exceeding legal limits on foreign ownership in Mexican companies. 
Alfa recently sold a 49% stake in its paper-producing subsidiary to Chicago-based Stone Container Corp., which is providing a major infusion of capital. 

   And in the biggest sign yet of its resurgence, Alfa is seeking bank financing for about one-third of the cost of a new $120 million petrochemical plant. 
Though this might seem like heading down the same road that led to trouble before, the company says it's a different story now: The dollar loans would be backed by dollar revenues from the plant's exports. 

   Some bitter foreign bankers say they will never consider making loans to Alfa again. 
Mr. Garza Sada thinks they'll come around eventually. 
"Bankers are business people," he says, "and if they see an attractive opportunity they will surely take it, no matter what the history is."

   A court here swept aside the takeover defenses of a pair of embattled supermarket chains, a move that could open the way for industrial restructurings in Japan through mergers and acquisitions. 

   While the country's cash-heavy corporations in recent years have relied on takeovers to build up market share and operations in the U.S. and Europe, the practice of buying and selling companies has remained relatively uncommon at home. 
Corporate autonomy usually has taken precedence over the ownership rights of shareholders, even big ones. 

   In a landmark decision yesterday, though, the Tokyo District Court invalidated an attempt by two supermarket operators, Chujitsuya Co. and Inageya Co., to protect themselves from a wealthy corporate raider. 
The unwelcome investor, closely held Shuwa Corp., wanted to meld the supermarket chains into a new, Tokyo-area retail giant. 

   Using a tried-and-proven Japanese evasion tactic, the two chains had sought to dilute Shuwa's large shareholdings by issuing stock to each other at sharply below-market prices. 
The exchange, which was announced early this month, effectively would have kept Shuwa from exercising power over the two supermarket chains by diminishing its voting rights. 
Shuwa went to court and won an injunction against the discounted cross-share placement -- a key reversal of what had been an accepted corporate tactic. 

   In its ruling, the Tokyo court found that the share swap was "unfair" to small shareholders, who had paid full market value for their investments, as well as to Shuwa, which was trying to build up ownership in the companies. 
The court said the share swap required approval from general shareholders' meetings -- a tacit endorsement of Shuwa's claim that shareholders should have ultimate control over the companies they own. 

   "Nobody thought this kind of merger and acquisition activity was really possible in Japan," said Peggy Furusaka, an analyst at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd. 
"The court decision could have very strong implications." 

   Added Kuniko Yoshioka, an analyst at Yamaichi Securities Co.'s research institute: "This seems to be a first step towards social acceptance of mergers and acquisitions as a normal thing." 
She called the court's ruling a "historic decision." 

   It also is something of a black eye for Japan's newly formed mergers-and-acquisitions firm Nomura Wasserstein Perella Co. 
The one-year-old joint venture of Japan's Nomura Securities Co. and Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. of the U.S., advised the supermarket chains on their share swap. 
At first, the swap looked like a coup, since it seemed to defeat Shuwa. 
Now, it looks as if Nomura Wasserstein Perella got caught by the wave that spawned firms like Nomura Wasserstein Perella in the first place: the rise of mergers and acquisitions in Japan. 
Officials at Nomura Wasserstein Perella were unavailable for comment. 

   Not everybody believes this one case will lead to a flood of new mergers and acquisitions activity. 
"It's a great leap in logic to say that because Shuwa has succeeded, there's going to be more mergers and acquisitions," said one analyst. 

   Still, industry analysts hailed the Tokyo court's judgment as a signal to begin the restructuring of some of Japan's more backward industries. 
In the past, big, faltering companies have been merged to form more efficient groups, but such mergers usually have taken place under the auspices of the government or the companies' major creditor banks. 

   The retail industry may be the first to undergo a market-driven structural reform, even though a complete overhaul may take years. 

   Shuwa's main shareholder, property tycoon Shigeru Kobayashi, has said he wants to bring together a handful of medium-size supermarket chains to create a more efficient network of supermarkets in the Tokyo area. 
But the chains he holds stakes in don't have to surrender just because he's a big shareholder, and they may well resist for years. 

   At a joint press conference late yesterday in Tokyo, officials from the two supermarket chains said they won't appeal the court verdict against their share swap. 
But neither will they give in to Shuwa. 
They said they intend to maintain business ties, and may discuss a capital link-up again. 

   Shuwa officials didn't return calls yesterday, but they have said recently that they have other options, too. 
They could, for example, choose to sell Shuwa's holdings in Inageya and Chujitsuya to Japan's two existing supermarket giants, Daiei Inc. and Ito-Yokado Co., or a large retail company, Seibu/Saison Group. 

   Analysts said the incentives for consolidation in Japan's supermarket business are strong. 
"It's an industry that requires scale merits in order to be efficient," said Mike Allen, a retail analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd. 
He said family-owned stores with one or two employees still account for 60% of Japan's retail market. 
"The industry needs to be restructured," he said. 

   The court ruling yesterday ends the need for separate investigations by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry into the share swap between Chujitsuya and Inageya. 
Both investigations were begun earlier this month.

   American Stores Co. said a U.S. district court judge ordered the state of California to post a $16.3 million bond in order to continue a stay that is affecting American's acquisition of Lucky Stores Inc. 

   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp has been challenging the merger on antitrust grounds, claiming it would cost California consumers as much as $400 million a year, by reducing competition and raising prices. 
A federal appeals court dismissed an action by the California attorney general seeking to undo the merger, but then granted a 30-day stay to give him time to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. 

   A spokesman for the attorney general's office said, "We aren't going to post the bond." 
He said the state would ask the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to lift the bond requirement. 

   American acquired Lucky, based in Dublin, Calif., last year for $2.51 billion. 
Both grocery chains have substantial California operations. 
American Stores said it estimates it could save $1.3 million a week by fully integrating its operations with Lucky. 

   American Stores stock rose 37.5 cents yesterday to close at $64.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   Newport News Savings Bank was ordered by Virginia regulators to stop engaging in conflicts of interest and unsound loan practices that, in some cases, violated federal regulations. 

   The Virginia Corporation Commission's Bureau of Financial Institutions said it warned the bank that its officers and directors would be subject to removal if violations continued. 

   Gordon L. Gentry Jr., the bank's president and chief executive officer, said the bank had taken corrective action. 
The bank said three new outside directors were appointed to succeed Thomas R. Watkins, Kendall C. Jones and Theodore W. Potter, all of whom resigned. 
Mr. Potter continues as the bank's executive vice president and chief operating officer. 
Mr. Jones wouldn't comment and the other two men couldn't be reached. 

   The state's examination cited: sale of property to a director's relative without obtaining appraisals; purchasing insurance through a director-related agency without competitive bids; a loan made by a director to a bank borrower; and five directors participating in the construction of beach homes, denying the bank a development opportunity. 

   Mr. Gentry said the bank expected to report a consolidated loss for the year ended June 30, resulting in part from the need to increase its $900,000 loan-loss provision for fiscal 1989. 

   In 1988, the bank posted a loss of $1.8 million. 
As of March 31, the bank had total unaudited assets of $372.2 million and unaudited shareholders' equity of $21.7 million. 
Regulatory capital of $25.6 million exceeded federal requirements by $15.4 million.

   Bank lenders to Hooker Corp., the Sydney-based retailer and real estate developer abandoned plans to rescue the financially troubled company in a development that presages a potential liquidation. 

   In a statement, Hooker said a group of bank lenders terminated an agreement signed earlier this month that called for 42 of Hooker's bank creditors to forgo interest payments and maintain their current level of credit lines to Hooker for four months. 

   Those banks, whose loans aren't secured by specific assets, are owed about A$900 million (US$674 million). 
The accord also called for Hooker's biggest lenders to provide additional credit lines to the cash-strapped company. 

   Separately, people familiar with Hooker's U.S. operations said that First National Bank of Chicago has started foreclosure proceedings on Hooker's 800,000-square-foot Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia, S.C., which is scheduled to be completed this fall. 
First National Bank of Chicago declined comment. 
J. Frank Haasbeek, president of L.J. Hooker Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of Hooker, was unavailable for comment. 

   The collapse of the moratorium appears to damp the chances that B. Altman and Bonwit Teller will receive badly needed fall merchandise. 
"We haven't shipped B. Altman anything since mid-April, and this isn't going to make it better," said one New York supplier. 

   Frank DeRita, senior vice president, Congress Talcott Corp., a major factoring company, said, "Everybody in the factoring industry was looking for cash deposits or for standby letters of credit to be established. 
It's unfortunate, since these two chains are viable retail businesses." 

   Factoring companies buy retail receivables from apparel manufacturers and in many cases act as their credit managers. 
As such, they exert considerable influence in the market. 

   One person familiar with the bank negotiations said the talks broke down mainly over Hooker's need to quickly raise short-term funds. 
As part of the debt moratorium, a group of 10 of Hooker's biggest lenders was expected to ante up an additional A$60 million to A$100 million in credit lines. 
But the banks demanded that, unlike their other loans, those new lines be secured with Hooker assets. 

   Hooker asked the banks for an immediate injection of A$55 million, one banker says, but the banks weren't satisfied that Hooker could provide sufficient security for the new loans. 
Furthermore, the banks became aware that Hooker needed more cash than the creditors had thought. 

   Hooker officials in Australia refused to comment beyond the terse statement, which also threatened legal action against the banks because they haven't made the additional funds available and are terminating the so-called moratorium on debt repayments. 

   But bankers close to the situation say Hooker's bank lenders effectively are forcing the company voluntarily to ask the Australian courts to appoint a provisional liquidator as early as today. 
If the company's directors fail to do so, the banks are likely to ask the courts to appoint one, bankers say. 
A provisional liquidator can either restructure the company or sell off its assets. 

   John Tierney, managing director of Bank of Boston's Australian unit, which has unsecured loans to Hooker, said, "Everybody's prospects would have been better" if the bank negotiations hadn't broken down. 

   Hooker's liabilities totaled A$1.92 billion as of March 31. 
Of that, Australian and other international banks are owed A$1.6 billion. 
In addition to the A$900 million in unsecured loans that was covered by the moratorium, Hooker owes an additional A$700 million that is secured against specific Hooker assets, mainly in the U.S. 

   First National Bank of Chicago, a unit of First Chicago Corp., and Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia are among the largest of the secured lenders, whose loans are less risky than the unsecured credits, bankers say. 
U.S. banks are owed about A$250 million in unsecured loans, according to Philip Phin, Hooker's chief financial officer. 

   Hooker shares closed yesterday on the Australian Stock Exchange at 36 Australian cents a share, down six cents from the previous close. 
Early this year, the shares were trading above A$2 each. 

   One big shareholder who isn't happy with the latest turn of events is David Marriner, managing director of Fulham Holdings Ltd., a small Australian property investment company. 
Since early this month, Fulham has built about a 16% stake in Hooker. 

   Mr. Marriner says he hasn't been able to talk to Hooker's bankers and likewise has been shunned by Hooker's board. 
"We're sick of standing on the boundary line and not being taken seriously," he said, adding that Fulham may pursue some "agressive options" in the coming days.

   Bergen Brunswig Corp. is calling for redemption of all of its 7 5/8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2010 at a price of $1,045.75 for each $1,000 face amount, plus $11.65 of accrued interest. 

   The health-service and consumer-products distribution company originally issued $135 million of the debentures on July 1, 1985. 
Since then, about $3.7 million of the debentures have been converted into Class A common. 

   The company, which is in the process of phasing out its Class B common, said it will urge debenture holders to consider converting the debt into Class A common. 
The debentures are convertible, at $24.33 a share, into 41.1 shares of Class A common for each $1,000 debenture. 
That would give a total value of $1,253.55 for the converted debentures, based on the $30.50-a-share closing price of Bergen Brunswig's Class A common on Monday. 

   After Aug. 11, the debt will be convertible at an adjusted price of $19.46 a share into 51.39 shares of Class A common.

   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich's ethics troubles deepened. 
A business weekly questioned his use of staff salaries, and the House Ethics Committee hired Richard Phelan's law firm to review a complaint about his book deal. 

   The Atlanta Business Chronicle reported in this week's edition that Mr. Gingrich sharply increased the pay of two staff members temporarily after they worked on his 1988 re-election campaign. 
The Georgia Republican also gave similar bonuses to two other staff members after they worked on his 1986 campaign, the Chronicle said. 

   The news account suggested that Mr. Gingrich violated House rules forbidding payment of official staff salaries for political work. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Gingrich denied this, and said temporary, year-end salary increases are common in the House. 
But the matter seems certain to be scrutinized by the Ethics Committee, which last year recommended that Rep. Austin Murphy (D., Pa.) be reprimanded for, among other things, allowing a staff aide to draw pay without showing up for work. 

   Mr. Gingrich's press secretary Sheila Ward, one of those cited in the news story, was being paid at a rate of $19,278 a year before taking leave to work on the re-election campaign last Oct. 11. 
The campaign committee's reports show it paid her at about the same rate for the month she worked there. 
When she returned to the House payroll, Mr. Gingrich increased her government salary temporarily to a rate of more than $34,000 annually for the remainder of last year, before cutting it back to $22,000 a year in January. 
Miss Ward said the extra year-end pay was in recognition of long hours she worked in the House office. 
Anyway, she said, "It really only meant a few hundred dollars." 

   Rep. Gingrich already faces a review by the Ethics Committee, which announced it is hiring Mr. Phelan's Chicago law firm to review his case. 
It hired Mr. Phelan last year to investigate Rep. Gingrich's complaint against former Speaker James Wright. 
Mr. Phelan, a Democrat, is considering becoming a candidate for governor of Illinois. 
The Gingrich review is to be handled by his partner William Kunkle, a Republican. 

   A complaint filed by Rep. William Alexander (D., Ark.) alleges that Rep. Gingrich violated House rules when he raised $105,000 from 21 political supporters to promote his 1984 book "Window of Opportunity." 
The partnership paid Mr. Gingrich's wife Marianne $11,500, but the book didn't sell enough copies to return any money to investors, who claimed tax deductions for business losses. 
Mr. Gingrich says the book partnership was a legitimate business deal. 

   Rep. Gingrich promised to cooperate fully with the inquiry, adding, "I have always known that any complaint filed against me would receive intense scrutiny, even if unfounded."

   Now that Time Inc. has thwarted the hostile bid by Paramount Communications Inc., the big question is whether the players can salvage their business relationships from the wreckage of the mud-slinging, muckraking and bad blood of the takeover war. 

   Time completed the first step of its merger with Warner Communications Inc., and Paramount, in turn withdrew its $12.2 billion offer for Time. 
N.J. Nicholas, president of the new Time Warner Inc., says the company will continue to do business "on the merits" with Paramount, which is closely linked in a number of business ventures and contractual relationships. 
But analysts and industry executives wonder whether it can ever be business as usual again between the two sides after the hostilities of the fight. 

   Of equal concern, some industry executives say, is whether the battle that pitted Time and Warner against longtime supplier and partner Paramount signals a new era of antagonism among companies in the media business. 
Although Paramount lost its bid for Time, its willingness to make a hostile bid is a departure from past practice in the entertainment industry. 
And some in the industry worry that it may spur others to try the same tactic as U.S. companies scramble to follow Time's lead and get bigger, fast. 

   In an industry that in the past has been marked by fairly cordial relationships between the major players, the fight for control of Time "didn't exactly engender a collegial atmosphere," says Barry Diller, who once ran Paramount Pictures and is now Chairman of News Corp.'s Fox Inc. 
"This was a public and formal announcement that the hostilities have begun." 

   Industry executives believe the relationships between the two sides may be particularly strained because of the heated nature of the takeover battle. 
During much of the fight, Time executives railed at Paramount's top executives, particularly Chief Executive Martin S. Davis, accusing him of going back on his word in making a run at Time, a charge he has denied. 

   Time and Warner also hired a detective firm to dig up dirt on Paramount, and publicly derided the company by bringing up a number of past controversies the company has been involved in; Paramount retaliated by bringing up equally controversial issues in the background of Warner Chief Executive Steven J. Ross. 

   Among the more crucial relationships between Time Warner and Paramount is the long-term contract under which Time's Home Box Office unit is obligated to buy all of Paramount's movies for the next five years, a pact valued at more than $500 million. 
HBO began airing the new Paramount movies earlier this summer and will premiere "Crocodile Dundee 2" next month. 

   But Michael Fuchs, chairman of Home Box Office, says his attitude now is that the fight "was all done at the respective tops of the companies -- it had nothing to do with Frank Mancuso and his people." 
Mr. Mancuso, chairman of the Paramount Pictures unit, agrees. 
"The relationship with HBO has always been a good one, and nothing altered that during the course of the events in New York," he said. 
"There's no reason to believe anything will be any different going forward." 
And he said he and Mr. Davis will continue to nourish relationships that are "mutually beneficial" with Time Warner. 

   Paramount and Warner are also partners in Cinemerica Theaters. 
Warner bought a 50% interest in the theater chain from Paramount last year for $150 million, and the two have been closely linked in managing its operations. 
Mr. Mancuso says that during the takeover battle, he was in frequent contact with Warner Bros. 
Chairman Robert Daly and President Terry Semel. 
"We continued to function based on what was in the best interests of the partnership," he said. 

   The Cinemerica stake was identified by bankers involved in the Time purchase of Warner as a candidate for a potential sale to raise cash. 
But Time has said it hasn't made any such decisions and, in any event, the sale would be impossible without Paramount's consent. 

   Time and Warner are linked in other ways, too; combined, the Time Warner cable systems are among the largest buyers of Paramount's Madison Square Garden network and its 50%-owned USA Network. 
"We will continue to do business with Paramount as we would with any other company," Time's Mr. Nicholas said. 
"If we produce a product at Time Warner that Paramount can use, we hope they will stop here and buy from us." 
Mr. Nicholas added, "we will always do business with whoever has the best product."

   Major oil companies reported mixed results yesterday for the second quarter, with Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. showing profit declines due mostly to special items, while Phillips Petroleum Co. and Sun Co. reported gains. 

   Higher prices for crude oil benefited three of the companies, while narrower refining margins reduced results in most of their markets. 
The upturn at Sun, which no longer produces petroleum, reflected a $201 million year-earlier loss due to one-time charges related to the sale of its oil and gas properties. 

   Mobil said second-quarter net income slid 23%, to $401 million, or 98 cents a share, from $519 million, or $1.26 a share a year earlier, due mostly to a $140 million charge related to the company's previously reported sale of business operations in South Africa. 
The year-earlier results include $35 million from the discontinued operations of Montgomery Ward. 

   Domestic petroleum operations produced a 35% increase in after-tax profit, climbing to $191 million in the latest quarter from $141 million a year earlier. 
Foreign petroleum operations, reflecting the $140 million charge from South African operations, slid 49%, to $193 million from $378 million a year earlier. 

   Among other operations, after-tax profit from Mobil's chemicals business rose 14%, to $182 million from $160 million a year earlier. 
The latest period included a gain from the sale of assets that "substantially accounted for the increase," a spokesman said. 

   Revenue in the quarter climbed less than 1% to $14 billion from $13.95 billion a year earlier. 

   Chevron had a 22% drop in net income, to $404 million, or $1.18 a share, in the quarter from $520 million, or $1.52 a share, a year earlier. 
However, the company said one-time items reduced profit $10 million in the latest quarter and increased earnings $148 million a year earlier. 

   Domestic petroleum operations produced a 24% increase in after-tax profit, to $209 million from $169 million a year earlier. 
Included in the latest period are charges of $11 million for environmentally related expenses vs. charges of $48 million a year earlier. 

   After-tax profits from foreign petroleum operations slid 1.4%, to $136 million from $138 million a year earlier. 
After-tax profit from chemical operations rose 42% in the latest quarter, to $108 million from $76 million a year earlier, which included a $43 million charge for environmental programs. 

   Chevron's mineral operations' results fell 93%, to $13 million in the latest quarter from $184 million a year earlier, including a $177 million gain on the sale of Chevron's investment in Amax Inc. Foreign-exchange gains in the latest quarter totaled $1 million, vs. $16 million a year earlier. 

   Chevron's revenue rose 12% in the quarter to $8.21 billion from $7.32 billion. 

   Phillips Petroleum said net climbed to $197 million, or 81 cents a share, in the quarter from $170 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. 
The company said the latest period included a $21 million gain from a settlement of a dispute over a natural-gas contract. 
The company said it had improved results from oil and gas production in the latest period, while refining and marketing results were reduced by narrower margins and overhauls at the company's two major refineries. 

   Phillips's revenue grew 15% in the quarter, to $3.30 billion from $2.88 billion a year earlier. 

   Sun Co. reported profit of $105 million, or 98 cents a share, vs. a year-earlier loss of $201 million. 

   The year-ago results included $297 million of charges mostly related to U.S. exploration and production operations that have since been spun off to shareholders. 

   Revenue rose 20% to $2.92 billion from $2.43 billion a year earlier. 

   The energy company, based in Radnor, Pa., said profit in the latest quarter rose 9% from a year earlier after excluding the effects of the 1988 charges. 

   The company attributed the improvement mostly to higher earnings at its real-estate development unit, which had a $35 million gain on the sale of an interest in a Philadelphia office building. 

   Sun also noted higher earnings at its 75%-owned Canadian subsidiary, due to improved refining and marketing results. 
Earnings from U.S. marketing and refining fell, but only because of a big gain from a tax adjustment in the year-earlier quarter.

   Federal agents arrested Micheal Gruenberg, the 31-year-old founder of a once highflying Minnesota biotechnology company that plunged into bankruptcy-law proceedings in 1987 amid investigations by several regulators. 

   Mr. Gruenberg, who was forced to resign in 1987 as president of Endotronics Inc. of Coon Rapids, Minn., was arrested by U.S. Customs Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents as he was arriving at Los Angeles International Airport from Japan. 

   Mr. Gruenberg was charged with wire fraud. 
According to the U.S. Attorney in Minnesota, Mr. Gruenberg is accused of using $645,000 of company funds to reduce a personal loan at First Bank Minneapolis. 

   According to a U.S. Attorney spokeswoman, the money was from Westwater Financial Corp. for the purchase of Endotronics equipment, which Westwater planned to lease to Endotronics. 

   Endotronics's business practices under Mr. Gruenberg have been under investigation by the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a grand jury. 
Among other things, the FBI has investigated whether millions of dollars of sales were falsified. 

   Endotronics emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in March 1988 with new management, and continues to make cell culture instruments.

   Earlier this month, the Journal brought together four economists to discuss whether income in America is becoming more unequal: Barry Bluestone, professor of political economy at the University of Massachusetts; Frank Levy, professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs; Fabian Linden, executive director of the Consumer Research Center of the Conference Board; and Richard Vedder, professor at Ohio University. 

   ---

   WSJ: What is happening to income in America? 

   Bluestone: We see the following trends beginning in the early 1970s: first, stagnation if not an absolute decline in hourly wages, weekly earnings and average annual earnings; second, growing inequality in earnings, particularly among men; third, a growing proportion of the labor force earning lower wages, at least among full-time workers. 
There seems to have been very little reversal in any of those trends since the economic recovery beginning in 1983. 

   Levy: There's been a trend toward greater inequality in men's earnings in most of the post-World War II period -- it grows faster sometimes than other times, and that trend certainly has been there in the past decade. 
There is no particular trend one way or another in women's earnings. 

   If you look at family incomes, from the end of the Second World War to the late 1960s, family incomes grew moderately more equal. 
They grew sharply less equal in the early 1980s. 
Historically, inequality grows when you go into a recession and declines when you come out. 
But inequality today is greater than it was at the bottom of the recession. 

   When incomes are growing fast, inequality has less meaning because the poor are getting richer and the rich are getting richer even faster -- but everybody's better off. 
Because of the general stagnation of earnings this decade, that's not the case now. 
A relative decline means an absolute decline. 
The sharpest example is that if you look at workers in their late 20s and early 30s with a high school education, in the early 1970s they were averaging $22,000-$23,000 in today's dollars and today they are making $18,500. 

   And the last point is that there have been sharp changes in the kinds of families at the bottom of the distribution. 
In the 1960s, the bottom fifth of families contained maybe one-sixth of all kids; today it's one-quarter. 

   Linden: I don't think there's much debate that income has been growing much less rapidly than in the 1960s. 
But why is this going on? 
My view is that there have been monumental social and demographic changes in the country. 

   But it remains a fact that per-capita disposable income rose by a total of 82% between 1960 and 1987 -- and by 13% between 1980 and 1987. 
Per-capita disposable personal income rose by an annual rate of 1.8% from 1980 through 1987. 
At that rate, the standard of living of the average American doubles in 35 years. 
That's been our past trend, it is our current trend. 
When we survey young workers, they say they are doing considerably better than their parents were at their age. 
And they're right: On average, today's young have an income that is in real terms 50% higher than their parents' at the same age. 

   Vedder: From 1947 to 1967 economic growth reduced poverty; from 1967 to 1987 we see little if any decline in poverty even though there has been some economic growth. 
Why has economic growth not resulted in the continuation of the reduction in poverty? 
A decreasing proportion of the poor are working poor. 
Of the 7 million families that are poor, half don't contain a wage earner. 
Public policies are leading people to take options that consign them to poverty. 

   WSJ: Let's begin by considering individual earnings from labor. 
What's happening, and why? 

   Levy: Low wages among young high school graduates come from weak manufacturing employment. 
Manufacturing got clobbered in the recession, and then got the short end of the stick in the recovery because of the high dollar. 
Put aside the question of good jobs and bad jobs. 
Suppose you had a group of women and a large number went into secretarial positions. 
Suddenly you abolish half of those jobs. 
Women's average wages would fall, even if those vanished jobs weren't good jobs. 
In the '80s, a lot of young men without college educations had to scramble for any kind of job because the factories weren't hiring. 

   Bluestone: As it turns out, and I'm one of the proponents of the de-industrialization thesis, the shift in employment from goods production to services does not by itself explain the growth in inequality, because inequality is growing in all sectors. 
I think something is happening to educational criteria. 

   I went to a public high school in Detroit, and graduated in 1962. 
About half my class went on to college, half didn't. 
At my 10th and 20th class reunions, those who went on to college were making somewhat more than those who had not, but the gap wasn't enormous -- we were in Detroit, remember. 
But when the class of 1980 meets for its anniversary, I predict the gap will have grown enormously. 

   In goods production, college graduates earned 2.1 times as much as high school drop-outs in 1963. 
Today they earn 2.4 times as much. 
But the service economy is putting more and more of a premium on advanced education. 
So while college graduates in services earned 2.2 times as much as high school drop-outs in 1963, today they earn 3.5 times as much. 
There certainly is a relationship between the decline in manufacturing employment and the growth in inequality. 
But even more powerful, there has been a restructuring within industries. 

   Linden: But much of this is the impact of the baby boom generation. 
Within the prime age range of 25 to 54 -- when earnings are at their highest -- the proportion of the category accounted for by the younger, less well-paid cohort of 25- to 34-year-olds was 35% in 1970. 
In 1985, it was 44%. 

   Bluestone: But those are the same people who in the previous period of greater equality were even younger -- 16 to 24 -- and so they should have been lowering wage rates even more then. 

   Linden: But their participation in the labor force was very slight -- most of them were still in school. 

   Levy: The growth in inequality among younger workers is as important as the growth of inequality between younger and older workers, and between high school and college graduates. 
Inequality's grown a lot. 
The economy's in a lot of turbulence. 

   WSJ: Perhaps as the economy becomes more entrepreneurial -- as foreign competition mounts, as small business proliferates -- the price society is prepared to pay for talent is greater? 

   Linden: There was a period in which you could earn your bread by the sweat of your brow. 
Now, as the economy becomes more complex . . . 

   Bluestone: You have to use something above the brow. 

   Levy: The economy in the '50s and '60s was certainly not sclerotic, but the inequality in men's earnings was less than it is now. 
Compared to the early '70s, a larger proportion of men earns over $50,000 (in constant dollars) and a larger proportion earns under $20,000. 
But a smaller proportion is earning between $20,000 and $50,000. 
The top has increased because, if you want to put a good face on it, there is more recognition of talent, and if you want to put a bad face on it, because people feel less of a sense of restraint than they used to. 

   Markets are there all the time. 
But how much do you allow the full impact of the market to come to bear on wages, and how much do you dampen the market through custom? 
Certainly in the 1980s, we let more of the market be felt. 
If the minimum wage erodes through inflation, that's good. 
If you can get a really big salary by threatening to jump to another firm, even though it's nine times what your colleagues are making, go ahead, that's OK. 

   If you want to take it one step further, this may ultimately be traceable to the stagnation of earnings. 
When everybody is getting better off very fast, you may say, well, I've got mine. 
But when people get a little edgy about the future, there's more of a temptation to play for the short run. 

   Vedder: We all agree that the growth in earnings from work has slowed down dramatically since the mid-'70s. 
I won't agree to any specific numbers, because there are complex issues here -- fringe benefits, inflation deflators, the dates you use. 
But I don't think there's any question that the measures show some increase in inequality over the past 15 years. 

   Linden: Remember that the period from the end of the war to the 1960s was extraordinary. 
We had a depression and then a war in the 1930s and '40s, so there was a huge backlog of sophisticated technology that had not been implementedthere was a whole network of growth impetus. 

   Bluestone: But there's a whole series of institutional factors at work too. 
At one time in this country, we had more than a third of the labor force in unions -- in manufacturing, as much as 45%. 
By demanding raises in pennies per hour rather than in percentage terms, by fighting for promotion by seniority rather than pay for knowledge, unions have been a force for greater equality. 
With the demise of unions, you have a freer market in wages. 
A freer market has meant greater disparities. 
In 1988 the average chief executive of a Fortune 500 company earned 93 times as much as the average factory worker and 72 times as much as the average schoolteacher. 
In 1960, he made 41 times as much as a factory worker and 38 times as much as a teacher. 

   Levy: The big change was on the demand side. 
We know that manufacturing is very sensitive to recessions, and we also know that in this last recovery the high dollar was very hard on U.S. manufacturing. 
So you're suddenly taking a big chunk of the demand for less well-educated labor, and putting it into shock. 

   Linden: What you're saying is that we are having an economic episode, related to the fortunes of the dollar. 

   Levy: I would say . . . yes. 
But how long that episode lasts has a lot to do with public policy. 

   Linden: But an episode is nothing we have to be too desperately concerned about. 
It's painful to live through, but it will not continue. 

   Levy: But from the point of view of a young person, the question is, what are the chances that they're going to out-earn their parents? 
That depends on something I can't predict very well: productivity growth. 
A 30-year-old man today is pretty certainly making more than his father did when he was 30. 
The difference is, that the father saw pretty rapid wage growth for most of his career. 
For the son it's an open question. 
If you do simple projections, you will find that for the college-educated son of a college-educated father, the son will top out at about 4,000 or 5,000 constant dollars more than his father -- which isn't outstanding, but isn't bad. 
But for high school-educated sons of high school-educated fathers, at current projections, the son won't out-earn his father. 

   WSJ: What about college-educated sons of high school-educated fathers? 

   Levy: The proportion of high school graduates going on to college has stabilized at 50% since the early 1970s. 

   Linden: But in the generation of the fathers of the baby-boomers, only 25% went to college. 
That's one of the reasons that this notion of the baby-boomers not doing as well as their parents is nonsense. 
Of course, while they're doing better now, this is only a snapshot in time. 
Will they do better into the future? 
That's as unpredictable as tomorrow's GNP. 

   Vedder: From 1929 until 1968 we had an increase in equality combined with economic growth. 
Since 1968 we've had an increase of inequality along with some slowing of economic growth. 
But over the long run, that trend will probably reverse itself, even in the absence of public policy. 
What we should be worrying about are the very poor. 
We have not been terribly successful in eliminating poverty in the United States. 
That's where we should focus our attention. 

   WSJ: How important are racial and regional phenomena? 

   Vedder: The employment-to-population rate among blacks was higher in 1954 than it was in 1987: 58% vs. 56.8%. 
For whites, it rose: from 55.2% to 62.3%. 
I don't think anyone would seriously argue that it's because of increased racial discrimination. 
Part of the black decline does relate to things like changing skill requirements. 
But part of it relates to family structure, and to things that affect work effort, like public assistance. 

   Levy: Of course, for female-headed families earning less than $15,000, 60% are white. 

   Vedder: Maybe, but among unrelated individuals, inequality for whites has fallen. 
For blacks, it has risen. 
If you compare families, the GINI coefficient -- the technical measure of inequality -- has risen 68 basis points for blacks, and 40 for whites. 
And income disparity among blacks was greater than among whites to begin with. 

   Bluestone: While this is true among blacks, it's part of a general trend. 
The white high school graduate or drop-out isn't doing as well as 20 years ago either, in both relative and absolute terms. 

   Vedder: And for regions, reversing the recent history of the U.S., it's been the relatively high income states that had the highest growth rates in the 1980s. 

   Bluestone: In the six New England states, the proportion of the work force in low-wage jobs went down between 1979 and 1987. 
But everywhere else it went up. 
In the Midwest, it began rising in 1973 and exploded after 1979: from 12% to 15.4% In the South it went from 18% to 20%; in the West, from 12% to 15%. 

   Levy: But most of that decline is concentrated in the Middle West. 
If you take out the big industrial states, the high school/college gap in wage rates among young men hasn't changed a whole lot. 
And there's your story: Heavy industry is falling apart. 

   Linden: But autos and steel account for just 2% or 3% of total employment. 
We have lost vastly more industrial jobs in low-paying textile and apparel industries. 

   Levy: It isn't just autos and steel that are being removed when you take out those states. 

   Bluestone: And even for people in textiles, those jobs are better than the alternatives -- working as security guards, or janitors, or in warehouses, or frying hamburgers. 
And the benefits of course were much greater, even in the lower-wage manufacturing industries. 

   WSJ: Let's go beyond the individual earnings data. 
What's happening to total family income? 

   Levy: Income per worker really has slowed down. 
Family living standards haven't suffered as much, but that's because we now have two-income families with one kid instead of one-income families with three kids. 
And also because, even as male-earnings inequality has grown, female-income inequality has been unchanged. 

   Linden: In the lowest quintile of the family income distribution, single-parent families grew between 1970 and 1987 from 33% to 46% of the total family population. 
Over those 17 years, there was a 10% increase in the number of husband-wife families; while other families increased by 90%. 

   Of the total increase between 1970 and 1987 in households earning less than $15,000 55% were single individuals, 28% were female-headed families. 

   In the top quintile of families, there has been an extraordinary growth in the number of working wives. 
In 1970, some 50% of the families in the top fifth had working wives; in 1987, some 66%. 
The number of working wives in the top quintile increased by 70%. 

   How much do these pulls increase inequality? 
It's difficult to say. 
But these are not small changes. 
These are monumental changes because the baby boom was monumental. 
Just between 1980 and 1987, the total number of persons working went up by 6%. 

   Vedder: In real terms -- not in nominal terms -- in real terms, payments to individuals by the United States government went up from 152 billion 1982 dollars in 1970 to $405 billion in 1988. 
That has implications for all kinds of things, including family structure and work effort. 

   Among low-income Americans, there is a very significant negative tax in the form of new benefits that have appeared since the 1960s: Medicaid, food stamps, WIC benefits, that have impacted adversely on low-income Americans' participation in the labor force. 
At the upper end of the spectrum, meanwhile, labor force participation is increasing. 
Why? 
Partly because you have some impact when you cut the marginal tax rate from 70% to 28%. 

   Levy: But inequality in family incomes increases faster when you ignore wives' incomes. 
The two-income family exerts less of an equalizing force than it did 10 years ago, because it's more acceptable for the wives of high-income men to work than it used to be; but even so, if you ignored all wives' incomes, you'd have more, not less, inequality. 

   Inequality is certainly exacerbated by the growing number of female-headed families. 
The reason the number is growing is open to question: welfare, changes in the economy, in mores, God knows what. 

   From about 1967 to about 1974, the number of cases on the welfare rolls doubled. 
You'd be a fool not to attribute a good part of that doubling to the raising of benefits and the attachment of food stamps and Medicaid to welfare. 
But since 1975 the cash value of welfare has fallen off substantially-and the number of femaleheaded families continues to grow, just as it had grown in the early '60s before the benefits were raised. 

   More and more women are divorced or are having kids out of wedlock. 
How good the welfare programs are may determine how many will be on welfare as opposed to doing something else. 
But that's it. 

   ---

   Where They Agree: 

   1.
Average earnings per hour have not improved during the '80s, despite the economic recovery. 

   2.
By all the conventional statistical measures of inequality, the inequality of earnings among men has increased during the decade. 

   3.
Inequality of earnings among women has not. 

   4.
The composition of the poor has changed dramatically: The working poor and the elderly poor have declined as a share of the total. 
In their place is a rising share of female-headed, non-working households -- a majority of them white. 

   5.
Conventional statistical measures also show that inequality of family income has grown, though not so dramatically as inequality of male earnings. 

   Where They Disagree: 

   1.
Whether the increase in the inequality of male earnings is best explained demographically -- by the changing age structure of the population -- or by the changing nature of the American economy's demand for labor. 

   2.
Whether this increase in earnings inequality is going to be self-correcting. 

   3.
